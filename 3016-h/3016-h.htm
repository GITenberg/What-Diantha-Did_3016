      CHAPTER I. HANDICAPPED
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     One may use the Old Man of the Sea,
      For a partner or patron,
     But helpless and hapless is he
     Who is ridden, inextricably,
      By a fond old mer-matron.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Warden house was more impressive in appearance than its neighbors. It
      had &ldquo;grounds,&rdquo; instead of a yard or garden; it had wide pillared porches
      and &ldquo;galleries,&rdquo; showing southern antecedents; moreover, it had a cupola,
      giving date to the building, and proof of the continuing ambitions of the
      builders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stately mansion was covered with heavy flowering vines, also with
      heavy mortgages. Mrs. Roscoe Warden and her four daughters reposed
      peacefully under the vines, while Roscoe Warden, Jr., struggled
      desperately under the mortgages.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slender, languid lady was Mrs. Warden, wearing her thin but still brown
      hair in &ldquo;water-waves&rdquo; over a pale high forehead. She was sitting on a
      couch on the broad, rose-shaded porch, surrounded by billowing masses of
      vari-colored worsted. It was her delight to purchase skein on skein of
      soft, bright-hued wool, cut it all up into short lengths, tie them
      together again in contrasting colors, and then crochet this hashed rainbow
      into afghans of startling aspect. California does not call for afghans to
      any great extent, but &ldquo;they make such acceptable presents,&rdquo; Mrs. Warden
      declared, to those who questioned the purpose of her work; and she
      continued to send them off, on Christmases, birthdays, and minor weddings,
      in a stream of pillowy bundles. As they were accepted, they must have been
      acceptable, and the stream flowed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Around her, among the gay blossoms and gayer wools, sat her four
      daughters, variously intent. The mother, a poetic soul, had named them
      musically and with dulcet rhymes: Madeline and Adeline were the two
      eldest, Coraline and Doraline the two youngest. It had not occurred to her
      until too late that those melodious terminations made it impossible to
      call one daughter without calling two, and that &ldquo;Lina&rdquo; called them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mis' Immerjin,&rdquo; said a soft voice in the doorway, &ldquo;dere pos'tively ain't
      no butter in de house fer supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No butter?&rdquo; said Mrs. Warden, incredulously. &ldquo;Why, Sukey, I'm sure we had
      a tub sent up last&mdash;last Tuesday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week ago Tuesday, more likely, mother,&rdquo; suggested Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Dora! It was this week, wasn't it, girls?&rdquo; The mother appealed
      to them quite earnestly, as if the date of that tub's delivery would
      furnish forth the supper-table; but none of the young ladies save Dora had
      even a contradiction to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I never notice things,&rdquo; said the artistic Cora; and &ldquo;the
      de-lines,&rdquo; as their younger sisters called them, said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might borrow some o' Mis' Bell?&rdquo; suggested Sukey; &ldquo;dat's nearer 'n' de
      sto'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do, Sukey,&rdquo; her mistress agreed. &ldquo;It is so hot. But what have you
      done with that tubful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, some I tuk back to Mis' Bell for what I borrered befo'&mdash;I'm
      always most careful to make return for what I borrers&mdash;and yo' know,
      Mis' Warden, dat waffles and sweet potaters and cohn bread dey do take
      butter; to say nothin' o' them little cakes you all likes so well&mdash;<i>an''</i>
      de fried chicken, <i>an''</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, Sukey; you go and present my compliments to Mrs. Bell, and
      ask her for some; and be sure you return it promptly. Now, girls, don't
      let me forget to tell Ross to send up another tub.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't seem to remember any better than you can, mother,&rdquo; said Adeline,
      dreamily. &ldquo;Those details are so utterly uninteresting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it was Sukey's business to tell him,&rdquo; said Madeline with
      decision; while the &ldquo;a-lines&rdquo; kept silence this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! Sukey's gone!&rdquo; Mrs. Warden suddenly remarked, watching the stout
      figure moving heavily away under the pepper trees. &ldquo;And I meant to have
      asked her to make me a glass of shrub! Dora, dear, you run and get it for
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dora laid down her work, not too regretfully, and started off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That child is the most practical of any of you,&rdquo; said her mother; which
      statement was tacitly accepted. It was not extravagant praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora poked about in the refrigerator for a bit of ice. She had no idea of
      the high cost of ice in that region&mdash;it came from &ldquo;the store,&rdquo; like
      all their provisions. It did not occur to her that fish and milk and
      melons made a poor combination in flavor; or that the clammy,
      sub-offensive smell was not the natural and necessary odor of
      refrigerators. Neither did she think that a sunny corner of the back porch
      near the chimney, though convenient, was an ill-selected spot for a
      refrigerator. She couldn't find the ice-pick, so put a big piece of ice in
      a towel and broke it on the edge of the sink; replaced the largest
      fragment, used what she wanted, and left the rest to filter slowly down
      through a mass of grease and tea-leaves; found the raspberry vinegar, and
      made a very satisfactory beverage which her mother received with grateful
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, my darling,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish you'd made a pitcherful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you, Do?&rdquo; her sisters demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're too late,&rdquo; said Dora, hunting for her needle and then for her
      thimble, and then for her twist; &ldquo;but there's more in the kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather go without than go into the kitchen,&rdquo; said Adeline; &ldquo;I do
      despise a kitchen.&rdquo; And this seemed to be the general sentiment; for no
      one moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother always liked raspberry shrub,&rdquo; said Mrs. Warden; &ldquo;and your Aunt
      Leicester, and your Raymond cousins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Warden had a wide family circle, many beloved relatives,
      &ldquo;connections&rdquo; of whom she was duly proud and &ldquo;kin&rdquo; in such widening
      ramifications that even her carefully reared daughters lost track of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You young people don't seem to care about your cousins at all!&rdquo; pursued
      their mother, somewhat severely, setting her glass on the railing, from
      whence it was presently knocked off and broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the fifth!&rdquo; remarked Dora, under breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should we, Ma?&rdquo; inquired Cora. &ldquo;We've never seen one of them&mdash;except
      Madam Weatherstone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll never forget <i>her!&rdquo;</i> said Madeline, with delicate decision,
      laying down the silk necktie she was knitting for Roscoe. &ldquo;What <i>beautiful</i>
      manners she had!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How rich is she, mother? Do you know?&rdquo; asked Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rich enough to do something for Roscoe, I'm sure, if she had a proper
      family spirit,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Warden. &ldquo;Her mother was own cousin to my
      grandmother&mdash;one of the Virginia Paddingtons. Or she might do
      something for you girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish she would!&rdquo; Adeline murmured, softly, her large eyes turned to the
      horizon, her hands in her lap over the handkerchief she was marking for
      Roscoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be ungrateful, Adeline,&rdquo; said her mother, firmly. &ldquo;You have a good
      home and a good brother; no girl ever had a better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there is never anything going on,&rdquo; broke in Coraline, in a tone of
      complaint; &ldquo;no parties, no going away for vacations, no anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Cora, don't be discontented! You must not add a straw to dear
      Roscoe's burdens,&rdquo; said her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, mother; I wouldn't for the world. I never saw her but that
      once; and she wasn't very cordial. But, as you say, she might do <i>something.</i>
      She might invite us to visit her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she ever comes back again, I'm going to recite for her,&rdquo; said, Dora,
      firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother gazed fondly on her youngest. &ldquo;I wish you could, dear,&rdquo; she
      agreed. &ldquo;I'm sure you have talent; and Madam Weatherstone would recognize
      it. And Adeline's music too. And Cora's art. I am very proud of my girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cora sat where the light fell well upon her work. She was illuminating a
      volume of poems, painting flowers on the margins, in appropriate places&mdash;for
      Roscoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if he'll care for it?&rdquo; she said, laying down her brush and
      holding the book at arm's length to get the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he will!&rdquo; answered her mother, warmly. &ldquo;It is not only the
      beauty of it, but the affection! How are you getting on, Dora?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dora was laboring at a task almost beyond her fourteen years, consisting
      of a negligee shirt of outing flannel, upon the breast of which she was
      embroidering a large, intricate design&mdash;for Roscoe. She was an
      ambitious child, but apt to tire in the execution of her large projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it'll be done,&rdquo; she said, a little wearily. &ldquo;What are you going
      to give him, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another bath-robe; his old one is so worn. And nothing is too good for my
      boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's coming,&rdquo; said Adeline, who was still looking down the road; and they
      all concealed their birthday work in haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall, straight young fellow, with an air of suddenly-faced maturity upon
      him, opened the gate under the pepper trees and came toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the finely molded features we see in portraits of handsome
      ancestors, seeming to call for curling hair a little longish, and a rich
      profusion of ruffled shirt. But his hair was sternly short, his shirt
      severely plain, his proudly carried head spoke of effort rather than of
      ease in its attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora skipped to meet him, Cora descended a decorous step or two. Madeline
      and Adeline, arm in arm, met him at the piazza edge, his mother lifted her
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother, dear!&rdquo; Affectionately he stooped and kissed her, and she
      held his hand and stroked it lovingly. The sisters gathered about with
      teasing affection, Dora poking in his coat-pocket for the stick candy her
      father always used to bring her, and her brother still remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you home early, dear?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Warden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I had a little headache&rdquo;&mdash;he passed his hand over his forehead&mdash;&ldquo;and
      Joe can run the store till after supper, anyhow.&rdquo; They flew to get him
      camphor, cologne, a menthol-pencil. Dora dragged forth the wicker lounge.
      He was laid out carefully and fanned and fussed over till his mother drove
      them all away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, just rest,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It's an hour to supper time yet!&rdquo; And she
      covered him with her latest completed afghan, gathering up and carrying
      away the incomplete one and its tumultuous constituents.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad of the quiet, the fresh, sweet air, the smell of flowers
      instead of the smell of molasses and cheese, soap and sulphur matches. But
      the headache did not stop, nor the worry that caused it. He loved his
      mother, he loved his sisters, he loved their home, but he did not love the
      grocery business which had fallen so unexpectedly upon him at his father's
      death, nor the load of debt which fell with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That they need never have had so large a &ldquo;place&rdquo; to &ldquo;keep up&rdquo; did not
      occur to him. He had lived there most of his life, and it was home. That
      the expenses of running the household were three times what they needed to
      be, he did not know. His father had not questioned their style of living,
      nor did he. That a family of five women might, between them, do the work
      of the house, he did not even consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Warden's health was never good, and since her husband's death she had
      made daily use of many afghans on the many lounges of the house. Madeline
      was &ldquo;delicate,&rdquo; and Adeline was &ldquo;frail&rdquo;; Cora was &ldquo;nervous,&rdquo; Dora was
      &ldquo;only a child.&rdquo; So black Sukey and her husband Jonah did the work of the
      place, so far as it was done; and Mrs. Warden held it a miracle of
      management that she could &ldquo;do with one servant,&rdquo; and the height of womanly
      devotion on her daughters' part that they dusted the parlor and arranged
      the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roscoe shut his eyes and tried to rest, but his problem beset him
      ruthlessly. There was the store&mdash;their one and only source of income.
      There was the house, a steady, large expense. There were five women to
      clothe and keep contented, beside himself. There was the unappeasable
      demand of the mortgage&mdash;and there was Diantha.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Warden died, some four years previously, Roscoe was a lad of
      about twenty, just home from college, full of dreams of great service to
      the world in science, expecting to go back for his doctor's degree next
      year. Instead of which the older man had suddenly dropped beneath the
      burden he had carried with such visible happiness and pride, such unknown
      anxiety and straining effort; and the younger one had to step into the
      harness on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was brave, capable, wholly loyal to his mother and sisters, reared in
      the traditions of older days as to a man's duty toward women. In his first
      grief for his father, and the ready pride with which he undertook to fill
      his place, he had not in the least estimated the weight of care he was to
      carry, nor the time that he must carry it. A year, a year or two, a few
      years, he told himself, as they passed, and he would make more money; the
      girls, of course, would marry; he could &ldquo;retire&rdquo; in time and take up his
      scientific work again. Then&mdash;there was Diantha.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he found he loved this young neighbor of theirs, and that she loved
      him, the first flush of happiness made all life look easier. They had been
      engaged six months&mdash;and it was beginning to dawn upon the young man
      that it might be six years&mdash;or sixteen years&mdash;before he could
      marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not sell the business&mdash;and if he could, he knew of no better
      way to take care of his family. The girls did not marry, and even when
      they did, he had figured this out to a dreary certainty, he would still
      not be free. To pay the mortgages off, and keep up the house, even without
      his sisters, would require all the money the store would bring in for some
      six years ahead. The young man set his teeth hard and turned his head
      sharply toward the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was Diantha.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood at the gate and smiled at him. He sprang to his feet,
      headacheless for the moment, and joined her. Mrs. Warden, from the lounge
      by her bedroom window, saw them move off together, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Roscoe!&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;It is very hard for him. But he
      carries his difficulties nobly. He is a son to be proud of.&rdquo; And she wept
      a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha slipped her hand in his offered arm&mdash;he clasped it warmly
      with his, and they walked along together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't come in and see mother and the girls?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you; not this time. I must get home and get supper. Besides,
      I'd rather see just you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He felt it a pity that there were so many houses along the road here, but
      squeezed her hand, anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him keenly. &ldquo;Headache?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it's nothing; it's gone already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worry?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose it is,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But I ought not to worry. I've got a
      good home, a good mother, good sisters, and&mdash;you!&rdquo; And he took
      advantage of a high hedge and an empty lot on either side of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha returned his kiss affectionately enough, but seemed preoccupied,
      and walked in silence till he asked her what she was thinking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About you, of course,&rdquo; she answered, brightly. &ldquo;There are things I want
      to say; and yet&mdash;I ought not to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can say anything on earth to me,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are twenty-four,&rdquo; she began, musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admitted at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'm twenty-one and a half.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's no such awful revelation, surely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we've been engaged ever since my birthday,&rdquo; the girl pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these are facts, dearest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Ross, will you be perfectly frank with me? May I ask you an&mdash;an
      impertinent question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may ask me any question you like; it couldn't be impertinent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be scandalised, I know&mdash;but&mdash;well, here goes. What would
      you think if Madeline&mdash;or any of the girls&mdash;should go away to
      work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her lovingly, but with a little smile on his firm mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't allow it,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&mdash;allow it? I asked you what you'd think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it was a disgrace to the family, and a direct reproach to
      me,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;But it's no use talking about that. None of the girls
      have any such foolish notion. And I wouldn't permit it if they had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha smiled. &ldquo;I suppose you never would permit your wife to work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My widow might have to&mdash;not my wife.&rdquo; He held his fine head a trifle
      higher, and her hand ached for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't you let me work&mdash;to help you, Ross?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest girl, you've got something far harder than that to do for me,
      and that's wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face darkened again, and he passed his hand over his forehead.
      &ldquo;Sometimes I feel as if I ought not to hold you at all!&rdquo; he burst out,
      bitterly. &ldquo;You ought to be free to marry a better man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There aren't any!&rdquo; said Diantha, shaking her head slowly from side to
      side. &ldquo;And if there were&mdash;millions&mdash;I wouldn't marry any of 'em.
      I love <i>you,&rdquo;</i> she firmly concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we'll just <i>wait,&rdquo;</i> said he, setting his teeth on the word, as
      if he would crush it. &ldquo;It won't be hard with you to help. You're better
      worth it than Rachael and Leah together.&rdquo; They walked a few steps
      silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how about science?&rdquo; she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't let myself think of it. I'll take that up later. We're young
      enough, both of us, to wait for our happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you any idea&mdash;we might as well face the worst&mdash;how
      many years do you think that will be, dearest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was a little annoyed at her persistence. Also, though he would not
      admit the thought, it did not seem quite the thing for her to ask. A woman
      should not seek too definite a period of waiting. She ought to trust&mdash;to
      just wait on general principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can face a thing better if I know just what I'm facing,&rdquo; said the girl,
      quietly, &ldquo;and I'd wait for you, if I had to, all my life. Will it be
      twenty years, do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked relieved. &ldquo;Why, no, indeed, darling. It oughtn't to be at the
      outside more than five. Or six,&rdquo; he added, honest though reluctant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, father had no time to settle anything; there were outstanding
      accounts, and the funeral expenses, and the mortgages. But the business is
      good; and I can carry it; I can build it up.&rdquo; He shook his broad shoulders
      determinedly. &ldquo;I should think it might be within five, perhaps even less.
      Good things happen sometimes&mdash;such as you, my heart's delight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were at her gate now, and she stood a little while to say good-night.
      A step inside there was a seat, walled in by evergreen, roofed over by the
      wide acacia boughs. Many a long good-night had they exchanged there, under
      the large, brilliant California moon. They sat there, silent, now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha's heart was full of love for him, and pride and confidence in him;
      but it was full of other feelings, too, which he could not fathom. His
      trouble was clearer to her than to him; as heavy to bear. To her mind,
      trained in all the minutiae of domestic economy, the Warden family lived
      in careless wastefulness. That five women&mdash;for Dora was older than
      she had been when she began to do housework&mdash;should require servants,
      seemed to this New England-born girl mere laziness and pride. That two
      voting women over twenty should prefer being supported by their brother to
      supporting themselves, she condemned even more sharply. Moreover, she felt
      well assured that with a different family to &ldquo;support,&rdquo; Mr. Warden would
      never have broken down so suddenly and irrecoverably. Even that funeral&mdash;her
      face hardened as she thought of the conspicuous &ldquo;lot,&rdquo; the continual
      flowers, the monument (not wholly paid for yet, that monument, though this
      she did not know)&mdash;all that expenditure to do honor to the man they
      had worked to death (thus brutally Diantha put it) was probably enough to
      put off their happiness for a whole year.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose at last, her hand still held in his. &ldquo;I'm sorry, but I've got to
      get supper, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you must go. Good-night for the present;
      you'll be round by and by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for a little while, after we close up,&rdquo; said he, and took himself
      off, not too suddenly, walking straight and proud while her eyes were on
      him, throwing her a kiss from the corner; but his step lagging and his
      headache settling down upon him again as he neared the large house with
      the cupola.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha watched him out of sight, turned and marched up the path to her
      own door, her lips set tight, her well-shaped head as straightly held as
      his. &ldquo;It's a shame, a cruel, burning shame!&rdquo; she told herself
      rebelliously. &ldquo;A man of his ability. Why, he could do anything, in his own
      work! And he loved it so!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To keep a grocery store!!!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And nothing to show for all that splendid effort!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't do a thing? They just <i>live</i>&mdash;and 'keep house!' All
      those women!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six years? Likely to be sixty! But I'm not going to wait!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER II. AN UNNATURAL DAUGHTER
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The brooding bird fulfills her task,
      Or she-bear lean and brown;
     All parent beasts see duty true,
     All parent beasts their duty do,
     We are the only kind that asks
      For duty upside down.
</pre>
    <p>
      The stiff-rayed windmill stood like a tall mechanical flower, turning
      slowly in the light afternoon wind; its faint regular metallic squeak
      pricked the dry silence wearingly. Rampant fuchsias, red-jewelled, heavy,
      ran up its framework, with crowding heliotrope and nasturtiums. Thick
      straggling roses hung over the kitchen windows, and a row of dusty
      eucalyptus trees rustled their stiff leaves, and gave an ineffectual shade
      to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of those small frame houses common to the northeastern states,
      which must be dear to the hearts of their dwellers. For no other reason,
      surely, would the cold grey steep-roofed little boxes be repeated so
      faithfully in the broad glow of a semi-tropical landscape. There was an
      attempt at a &ldquo;lawn,&rdquo; the pet ambition of the transplanted easterner; and a
      further attempt at &ldquo;flower-beds,&rdquo; which merely served as a sort of
      springboard to their far-reaching products.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parlor, behind the closed blinds, was as New England parlors are;
      minus the hint of cosiness given by even a fireless stove; the little
      bedrooms baked under the roof; only the kitchen spoke of human living, and
      the living it portrayed was not, to say the least, joyous. It was clean,
      clean with a cleanness that spoke of conscientious labor and unremitting
      care. The zinc mat under the big cook-stove was scoured to a dull glimmer,
      while that swart altar itself shone darkly from its daily rubbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no dust nor smell of dust; no grease spots, no litter anywhere.
      But the place bore no atmosphere of contented pride, as does a Dutch,
      German or French kitchen, it spoke of Labor, Economy and Duty&mdash;under
      restriction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dead quiet of the afternoon Diantha and her mother sat there
      sewing. The sun poured down through the dangling eucalyptus leaves. The
      dry air, rich with flower odors, flowed softly in, pushing the white sash
      curtains a steady inch or two. Ee-errr!&mdash;Ee-errr!&mdash;came the
      faint whine of the windmill.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the older woman rocking in her small splint chair by the rose-draped
      window, her thoughts dwelling on long dark green grass, the shade of elms,
      and cows knee-deep in river-shallows; this was California&mdash;hot, arid,
      tedious in endless sunlight&mdash;a place of exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the younger, the long seam of the turned sheet pinned tightly to her
      knee, her needle flying firmly and steadily, and her thoughts full of
      pouring moonlight through acacia boughs and Ross's murmured words, it was
      California&mdash;rich, warm, full of sweet bloom and fruit, of boundless
      vitality, promise, and power&mdash;home!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bell drew a long weary sigh, and laid down her work for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you stop it Mother dear? There's surely no hurry about these
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not particularly,&rdquo; her mother answered, &ldquo;but there's plenty else
      to do.&rdquo; And she went on with the long neat hemming. Diantha did the &ldquo;over
      and over seam&rdquo; up the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>do</i> you do it for anyway, Mother&mdash;I always hated this job&mdash;and
      you don't seem to like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They wear almost twice as long, child, you know. The middle gets worn and
      the edges don't. Now they're reversed. As to liking it&mdash;&rdquo; She gave a
      little smile, a smile that was too tired to be sarcastic, but which
      certainly did not indicate pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of work do you like best&mdash;really?&rdquo; her daughter inquired
      suddenly, after a silent moment or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;I don't know,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;I never thought of it. I never
      tried any but teaching. I didn't like that. Neither did your Aunt Esther,
      but she's still teaching.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you like any of it?&rdquo; pursued Diantha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I liked arithmetic best. I always loved arithmetic, when I went to school&mdash;used
      to stand highest in that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what part of housework do you like best?&rdquo; the girl persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bell smiled again, wanly. &ldquo;Seems to me sometimes as if I couldn't
      tell sometimes what part I like least!&rdquo; she answered. Then with sudden
      heat&mdash;&ldquo;O my Child! Don't you marry till Ross can afford at least one
      girl for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha put her small, strong hands behind her head and leaned back in her
      chair. &ldquo;We'll have to wait some time for that I fancy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But,
      Mother, there is one part you like&mdash;keeping accounts! I never saw
      anything like the way you manage the money, and I believe you've got every
      bill since you were married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I do love accounts,&rdquo; Mrs. Bell admitted. &ldquo;And I can keep run of
      things. I've often thought your Father'd have done better if he'd let me
      run that end of his business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha gave a fierce little laugh. She admired her father in some ways,
      enjoyed him in some ways, loved him as a child does if not ill-treated;
      but she loved her mother with a sort of passionate pity mixed with pride;
      feeling always nobler power in her than had ever had a fair chance to
      grow. It seemed to her an interminable dull tragedy; this graceful, eager,
      black-eyed woman, spending what to the girl was literally a lifetime, in
      the conscientious performance of duties she did not love.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew her mother's idea of duty, knew the clear head, the steady will,
      the active intelligence holding her relentlessly to the task; the chafe
      and fret of seeing her husband constantly attempting against her judgment,
      and failing for lack of the help he scorned. Young as she was, she
      realized that the nervous breakdown of these later years was wholly due to
      that common misery of &ldquo;the square man in the round hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She folded her finished sheet in accurate lines and laid it away&mdash;taking
      her mother's also. &ldquo;Now you sit still for once, Mother dear, read or lie
      down. Don't you stir till supper's ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And from pantry to table she stepped, swiftly and lightly, setting out
      what was needed, greased her pans and set them before her, and proceeded
      to make biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother watched her admiringly. &ldquo;How easy you do it!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I
      never could make bread without getting flour all over me. You don't spill
      a speck!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha smiled. &ldquo;I ought to do it easily by this time. Father's got to
      have hot bread for supper&mdash;or thinks he has!&mdash;and I've made 'em&mdash;every
      night when I was at home for this ten years back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess you have,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bell proudly. &ldquo;You were only eleven when you
      made your first batch. I can remember just as well! I had one of my bad
      headaches that night&mdash;and it did seem as if I couldn't sit up! But
      your Father's got to have his biscuit whether or no. And you said, 'Now
      Mother you lie right still on that sofa and let me do it! I can!' And you
      could!&mdash;you did! They were bettern' mine that first time&mdash;and
      your Father praised 'em&mdash;and you've been at it ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Diantha, with a deeper note of feeling than her mother caught,
      &ldquo;I've been at it ever since!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except when you were teaching school,&rdquo; pursued her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except when I taught school at Medville,&rdquo; Diantha corrected. &ldquo;When I
      taught here I made 'em just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you did,&rdquo; agreed her mother. &ldquo;So you did! No matter how tired you were&mdash;you
      wouldn't admit it. You always were the best child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I was tired it was not of making biscuits anyhow. I was tired enough
      of teaching school though. I've got something to tell you, presently,
      Mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She covered the biscuits with a light cloth and set them on the shelf over
      the stove; then poked among the greasewood roots to find what she wanted
      and started a fire. &ldquo;Why <i>don't</i> you get an oil stove? Or a gasoline?
      It would be a lot easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; her mother agreed. &ldquo;I've wanted one for twenty years; but you know
      your Father won't have one in the house. He says they're dangerous. What
      are you going to tell me, dear? I do hope you and Ross haven't
      quarrelled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed we haven't, Mother. Ross is splendid. Only&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what, Dinah?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only he's so tied up!&rdquo; said the girl, brushing every chip from the
      hearth. &ldquo;He's perfectly helpless there, with that mother of his&mdash;and
      those four sisters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ross is a good son,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bell, &ldquo;and a good brother. I never saw a
      better. He's certainly doing his duty. Now if his father'd lived you two
      could have got married by this time maybe, though you're too young yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha washed and put away the dishes she had used, saw that the pantry
      was in its usual delicate order, and proceeded to set the table, with
      light steps and no clatter of dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm twenty-one,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you're twenty-one,&rdquo; her mother allowed. &ldquo;It don't seem possible, but
      you are. My first baby!&rdquo; she looked at her proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Ross has to wait for all those girls to marry&mdash;and to pay his
      father's debts&mdash;I'll be old enough,&rdquo; said Diantha grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother watched her quick assured movements with admiration, and
      listened with keen sympathy. &ldquo;I know it's hard, dear child. You've only
      been engaged six months&mdash;and it looks as if it might be some years
      before Ross'll be able to marry. He's got an awful load for a boy to carry
      alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say he had!&rdquo; Diantha burst forth. &ldquo;Five helpless women!&mdash;or
      three women, and two girls. Though Cora's as old as I was when I began to
      teach. And not one of 'em will lift a finger to earn her own living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They weren't brought up that way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bell. &ldquo;Their mother don't
      approve of it. She thinks the home is the place for a woman&mdash;and so
      does Ross&mdash;and so do I,&rdquo; she added rather faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha put her pan of white puff-balls into the oven, sliced a quantity
      of smoked beef in thin shavings, and made white sauce for it, talking the
      while as if these acts were automatic. &ldquo;I don't agree with Mrs. Warden on
      that point, nor with Ross, nor with you, Mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;What I've got
      to tell you is this&mdash;I'm going away from home. To work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bell stopped rocking, stopped fanning, and regarded her daughter with
      wide frightened eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Diantha!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Why Diantha! You wouldn't go and leave your
      Mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha drew a deep breath and stood for a moment looking at the feeble
      little woman in the chair. Then she went to her, knelt down and hugged her
      close&mdash;close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not because I don't love you, Mother. It's because I do. And it's
      not because I don't love Ross either:&mdash;it's because I <i>do.</i> I
      want to take care of you, Mother, and make life easier for you as long as
      you live. I want to help him&mdash;to help carry that awful load&mdash;and
      I'm going&mdash;to&mdash;do&mdash;it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood up hastily, for a step sounded on the back porch. It was only
      her sister, who hurried in, put a dish on the table, kissed her mother and
      took another rocking-chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just ran in,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to bring those berries. Aren't they beauties?
      The baby's asleep. Gerald hasn't got in yet. Supper's all ready, and I can
      see him coming time enough to run back. Why, Mother! What's the matter?
      You're crying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Bell weakly; wiping her eyes in a dazed way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing to Mother, Diantha?&rdquo; demanded young Mrs. Peters.
      &ldquo;Bless me! I thought you and she never had any differences! I was always
      the black sheep, when I was at home. Maybe that's why I left so early!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked very pretty and complacent, this young matron and mother of
      nineteen; and patted the older woman's hand affectionately, demanding,
      &ldquo;Come&mdash;what's the trouble?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might as well know now as later,&rdquo; said her sister. &ldquo;I have decided to
      leave home, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To leave home!&rdquo; Mrs. Peters sat up straight and stared at her. &ldquo;To leave
      home!&mdash;And Mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Diantha, while the tears rose and ran over from her mother's
      eyes. &ldquo;Well, why not? You left home&mdash;and Mother&mdash;before you were
      eighteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's different!&rdquo; said her sister sharply. &ldquo;I left to be married,&mdash;to
      have a home of my own. And besides I haven't gone far! I can see Mother
      every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's one reason I can go now better than later on,&rdquo; Diantha said. &ldquo;You
      are close by in case of any trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth are you going for? Ross isn't ready to marry yet, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;nor likely to be for years. That's another reason I'm going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what <i>for,</i> for goodness sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To earn money&mdash;for one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you earn money enough by teaching?&rdquo; the Mother broke in eagerly. &ldquo;I
      know you haven't got the same place this fall&mdash;but you can get
      another easy enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha shook her head. &ldquo;No, Mother, I've had enough of that. I've taught
      for four years. I don't like it, I don't do well, and it exhausts me
      horribly. And I should never get beyond a thousand or fifteen hundred
      dollars a year if I taught for a lifetime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; said her sister. &ldquo;What do you <i>expect</i> to get? I
      should think fifteen hundred dollars a year was enough for any woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha peered into the oven and turned her biscuit pan around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you're meaning to leave home just to make money, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Diantha firmly. &ldquo;Henderson did&mdash;when he was eighteen.
      None of you blamed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see what that's got to do with it,&rdquo; her mother ventured.
      &ldquo;Henderson's a boy, and boys have to go, of course. A mother expects that.
      But a girl&mdash;Why, Diantha! How can I get along without you! With my
      health!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you'd be ashamed of yourself to think of such a thing!&rdquo;
       said young Mrs. Peters.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slow step sounded outside, and an elderly man, tall, slouching,
      carelessly dressed, entered, stumbling a little over the rag-mat at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father hasn't got used to that rug in fourteen years!&rdquo; said his youngest
      daughter laughingly. &ldquo;And Mother will straighten it out after him! I'm
      bringing Gerald up on better principles. You should just see him wait on
      me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man should be master in his own household,&rdquo; Mr. Bell proclaimed,
      raising a dripping face from the basin and looking around for the towel&mdash;which
      his wife handed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't have much household to be master of presently,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Peters provokingly. &ldquo;Half of it's going to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bell came out of his towel and looked from one to the other for some
      explanation of this attempted joke, &ldquo;What nonsense are you talking?&rdquo; he
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's nonsense myself,&rdquo; said the pretty young woman&mdash;her hand
      on the doorknob. &ldquo;But you'd better enjoy those biscuits of Di's while you
      can&mdash;you won't get many more! There's Gerald&mdash;good night!&rdquo; And
      off she ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha set the plateful on the table, puffy, brown, and crisply crusted.
      &ldquo;Supper's ready,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do sit down, Mother,&rdquo; and she held the chair
      for her. &ldquo;Minnie's quite right, Father, though I meant not to tell you
      till you'd had supper. I am going away to work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bell regarded his daughter with a stern, slow stare; not so much
      surprised as annoyed by an untimely jesting. He ate a hot biscuit in two
      un-Fletcherized mouthfuls, and put more sugar in his large cup of tea.
      &ldquo;You've got your Mother all worked up with your nonsense,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What
      are you talking about anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha met his eyes unflinchingly. He was a tall old man, still handsome
      and impressive in appearance, had been the head of his own household
      beyond question, ever since he was left the only son of an idolizing
      mother. But he had never succeeded in being the head of anything else.
      Repeated failures in the old New England home had resulted in his
      ruthlessly selling all the property there; and bringing his delicate wife
      and three young children to California. Vain were her protests and
      objections. It would do her good&mdash;best place in the world for
      children&mdash;good for nervous complaints too. A wife's duty was to
      follow her husband, of course. She had followed, willy nilly; and it was
      good for the children&mdash;there was no doubt of that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bell had profited little by his venture. They had the ranch, the
      flowers and fruit and ample living of that rich soil; but he had failed in
      oranges, failed in raisins, failed in prunes, and was now failing in
      wealth-promising hens.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Bell, though an ineffectual housekeeper, did not fail in the
      children. They had grown up big and vigorous, sturdy, handsome creatures,
      especially the two younger ones. Diantha was good-looking enough. Roscoe
      Warden thought her divinely beautiful. But her young strength had been
      heavily taxed from childhood in that complex process known as &ldquo;helping
      mother.&rdquo; As a little child she had been of constant service in caring for
      the babies; and early developed such competence in the various arts of
      house work as filled her mother with fond pride, and even wrung from her
      father some grudging recognition. That he did not value it more was
      because he expected such competence in women, all women; it was their
      natural field of ability, their duty as wives and mothers. Also as
      daughters. If they failed in it that was by illness or perversity. If they
      succeeded&mdash;that was a matter of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ate another of Diantha's excellent biscuits, his greyish-red whiskers
      slowly wagging; and continued to eye her disapprovingly. She said nothing,
      but tried to eat; and tried still harder to make her heart go quietly, her
      cheeks keep cool, and her eyes dry. Mrs. Bell also strove to keep a
      cheerful countenance; urged food upon her family; even tried to open some
      topic of conversation; but her gentle words trailed off into unnoticed
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bell ate until he was satisfied and betook himself to a comfortable
      chair by the lamp, where he unfolded the smart local paper and lit his
      pipe. &ldquo;When you've got through with the dishes, Diantha,&rdquo; he said coldly,
      &ldquo;I'll hear about this proposition of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha cleared the table, lowered the leaves, set it back against the
      wall, spreading the turkey-red cloth upon it. She washed the dishes,&mdash;her
      kettle long since boiling, scalded them, wiped them, set them in their
      places; washed out the towels, wiped the pan and hung it up, swiftly,
      accurately, and with a quietness that would have seemed incredible to any
      mistress of heavy-footed servants. Then with heightened color and firm-set
      mouth, she took her place by the lamplit table and sat still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother was patiently darning large socks with many holes&mdash;a kind
      of work she specially disliked. &ldquo;You'll have to get some new socks,
      Father,&rdquo; she ventured, &ldquo;these are pretty well gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O they'll do a good while yet,&rdquo; he replied, not looking at them. &ldquo;I like
      your embroidery, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That pleased her. She did not like to embroider, but she did like to be
      praised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha took some socks and set to work, red-checked and excited, but
      silent yet. Her mother's needle trembled irregularly under and over, and a
      tear or two slid down her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Mr. Bell laid down his finished paper and his emptied pipe and
      said, &ldquo;Now then. Out with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was not a felicitious opening. It is really astonishing how little
      diplomacy parents exhibit, how difficult they make it for the young to
      introduce a proposition. There was nothing for it but a bald statement, so
      Diantha made it baldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have decided to leave home and go to work,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you have work enough to do at home?&rdquo; he inquired, with the same air
      of quizzical superiority which had always annoyed her so intensely, even
      as a little child.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would cut short this form of discussion: &ldquo;I am going away to earn my
      living. I have given up school-teaching&mdash;I don't like it, and, there
      isn't money enough in it. I have plans&mdash;which will speak for
      themselves later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Mr. Bell, &ldquo;Plans all made, eh? I suppose you've considered your
      Mother in these plans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said his daughter. &ldquo;It is largely on her account that I'm
      going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it'll be good for your Mother's health to lose your assistance,
      do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know she'll miss me; but I haven't left the work on her shoulders. I am
      going to pay for a girl&mdash;to do the work I've done. It won't cost you
      any more, Father; and you'll save some&mdash;for she'll do the washing
      too. You didn't object to Henderson's going&mdash;at eighteen. You didn't
      object to Minnie's going&mdash;at seventeen. Why should you object to my
      going&mdash;at twenty-one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't objected&mdash;so far,&rdquo; replied her father. &ldquo;Have your plans
      also allowed for the affection and duty you owe your parents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done my duty&mdash;as well as I know how,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Now I am
      twenty-one, and self-supporting&mdash;and have a right to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes. You have a right&mdash;a legal right&mdash;if that's what you base
      your idea of a child's duty on! And while you're talking of rights&mdash;how
      about a parent's rights? How about common gratitude! How about what you
      owe to me&mdash;for all the care and pains and cost it's been to bring you
      up. A child's a rather expensive investment these days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha flushed, she had expected this, and yet it struck her like a blow.
      It was not the first time she had heard it&mdash;this claim of filial
      obligation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have considered that position, Father. I know you feel that way&mdash;you've
      often made me feel it. So I've been at some pains to work it out&mdash;on
      a money basis. Here is an account&mdash;as full as I could make it.&rdquo; She
      handed him a paper covered with neat figures. The totals read as follows:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Miss Diantha Bell,
     To Mr. Henderson R. Bell, Dr.

     To medical and dental expenses... $110.00
     To school expenses... $76.00
     To clothing, in full... $1,130.00
     To board and lodging at $3.00 a week... $2,184.00
     To incidentals... $100.00
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;      $3.600.00
</pre>
    <p>
      He studied the various items carefully, stroking his beard, half in anger,
      half in unavoidable amusement. Perhaps there was a tender feeling too, as
      he remembered that doctor's bill&mdash;the first he ever paid, with the
      other, when she had scarlet fever; and saw the exact price of the high
      chair which had served all three of the children, but of which she
      magnanimously shouldered the whole expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clothing total was so large that it made him whistle&mdash;he knew he
      had never spent $1,130.00 on one girl's clothes. But the items explained
      it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Materials, three years at an average of $10 a year... $30.00
   Five years averaging $20 each year... $100.00
   Five years averaging $30 each year... $50.00
   Five years averaging $50 each year... $250.00
   &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-   $530.00
</pre>
    <p>
      The rest was &ldquo;Mother's labor&rdquo;, averaging twenty full days a year at $2 a
      day, $40 a year. For fifteen years, $600.00. Mother's labor&mdash;on one
      child's, clothes&mdash;footing up to $600.00. It looked strange to see
      cash value attached to that unfailing source of family comfort and
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The school expenses puzzled him a bit, for she had only gone to public
      schools; but she was counting books and slates and even pencils&mdash;it
      brought up evenings long passed by, the sewing wife, the studying
      children, the &ldquo;Say, Father, I've got to have a new slate&mdash;mine's
      broke!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broken, Dina,&rdquo; her Mother would gently correct, while he demanded, &ldquo;How
      did you break it?&rdquo; and scolded her for her careless tomboy ways. Slates&mdash;three,
      $1.50&mdash;they were all down. And slates didn't cost so much come to
      think of it, even the red-edged ones, wound with black, that she always
      wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Board and lodging was put low, at $3.00 per week, but the items had a
      footnote as to house-rent in the country, and food raised on the farm.
      Yes, he guessed that was a full rate for the plain food and bare little
      bedroom they always had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's what Aunt Esther paid the winter she was here,&rdquo; said Diantha.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Circuses&mdash;three... $1.50
   Share in melodeon... $50.00
</pre>
    <p>
      Yes, she was one of five to use and enjoy it.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Music lessons... $30.00
</pre>
    <p>
      And quite a large margin left here, called miscellaneous, which he smiled
      to observe made just an even figure, and suspected she had put in for that
      purpose as well as from generosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This board account looks kind of funny,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;only fourteen
      years of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't take table-board&mdash;nor a room&mdash;the first year&mdash;nor
      much the second. I've allowed $1.00 a week for that, and $2.00 for the
      third&mdash;that takes out two, you see. Then it's $156 a year till I was
      fourteen and earned board and wages, two more years at $156&mdash;and I've
      paid since I was seventeen, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I guess you did&mdash;I guess you did.&rdquo; He grinned genially.
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he continued slowly, &ldquo;I guess that's a fair enough account.
      'Cording to this, you owe me $3,600.00, young woman! I didn't think it
      cost that much to raise a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;But here's the other side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the other side. He had never once thought of such a side to the
      case. This account was as clear and honest as the first and full of
      exasperating detail. She laid before him the second sheet of figures and
      watched while he read, explaining hurriedly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a clear expense for ten years&mdash;not counting help with the
      babies. Then I began to do housework regularly&mdash;when I was ten or
      eleven, two hours a day; three when I was twelve and thirteen&mdash;real
      work you'd have had to pay for, and I've only put it at ten cents an hour.
      When Mother was sick the year I was fourteen, and I did it all but the
      washing&mdash;all a servant would have done for $3.00 a week. Ever since
      then I have done three hours a day outside of school, full grown work now,
      at twenty cents an hour. That's what we have to pay here, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it mounted up:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Mr. Henderson R. Bell,
   To Miss Diantha Bell, Dr.

   For labor and services!!!!!

   Two years, two hours a day at 10c. an hour... $146.00
   Two years, three hours a day at 10c. an hour... $219.00
   One year, full wages at $5.00 a week... $260.00
   Six years and a half, three hours a day at 20c... $1423.50
   &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;   $2048.50
</pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Bell meditated carefully on these figures. To think of that child's
      labor footing up to two thousand dollars and over! It was lucky a man had
      a wife and daughters to do this work, or he could never support a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came her school-teaching years. She had always been a fine scholar
      and he had felt very proud of his girl when she got a good school position
      in her eighteenth year.
    </p>
    <p>
      California salaries were higher than eastern ones, and times had changed
      too; the year he taught school he remembered the salary was only $300.00&mdash;and
      he was a man. This girl got $600, next year $700, $800, $900; why it made
      $3,000 she had earned in four years. Astonishing. Out of this she had a
      balance in the bank of $550.00. He was pleased to see that she had been so
      saving. And her clothing account&mdash;little enough he admitted for four
      years and six months, $300.00. All incidentals for the whole time, $50.00&mdash;this
      with her balance made just $900. That left $2,100.00.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty-one hundred dollars unaccounted for, young lady!&mdash;besides
      this nest egg in the bank&mdash;I'd no idea you were so wealthy. What have
      you done with all that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Given it to you, Father,&rdquo; said she quietly, and handed him the third
      sheet of figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Board and lodging at $4.00 a week for 4 1/2 years made $936.00, that he
      could realize; but &ldquo;cash advance&rdquo; $1,164 more&mdash;he could not believe
      it. That time her mother was so sick and Diantha had paid both the doctor
      and the nurse&mdash;yes&mdash;he had been much cramped that year&mdash;and
      nurses come high. For Henderson, Jr.'s, expenses to San Francisco, and
      again for Henderson when he was out of a job&mdash;Mr. Bell remembered the
      boy's writing for the money, and his not having it, and Mrs. Bell saying
      she could arrange with Diantha.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrange! And that girl had kept this niggardly account of it! For Minnie's
      trip to the Yosemite&mdash;and what was this?&mdash;for his raisin
      experiment&mdash;for the new horse they simply had to have for the drying
      apparatus that year he lost so much money in apricots&mdash;and for the
      spraying materials&mdash;yes, he could not deny the items, and they
      covered that $1,164.00 exactly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the deadly balance, of the account between them:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Her labor... $2,047.00
   Her board... $936.00
   Her &ldquo;cash advanced&rdquo;... $1,164.00
   &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-   $4,147.00
   His expense for her... $3,600
   &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-   Due her from him... $547.00
</pre>
    <p>
      Diantha revolved her pencil between firm palms, and looked at him rather
      quizzically; while her mother rocked and darned and wiped away an
      occasional tear. She almost wished she had not kept accounts so well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bell pushed the papers away and started to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the most shameful piece of calculation I ever saw in my life,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;I never heard of such a thing! You go and count up in cold
      dollars the work that every decent girl does for her family and is glad
      to! I wonder you haven't charged your mother for nursing her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You notice I haven't,&rdquo; said Diantha coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; said he, gripping the back of a chair and looking down at
      her fiercely, &ldquo;to think that a girl who can earn nine hundred dollars a
      year teaching school, and stay at home and do her duty by her family
      besides, should plan to desert her mother outright&mdash;now she's old and
      sick! Of course I can't stop you! You're of age, and children nowadays
      have no sense of natural obligation after they're grown up. You can go, of
      course, and disgrace the family as you propose&mdash;but you needn't
      expect to have me consent to it or approve of it&mdash;or of you. It's a
      shameful thing&mdash;and you are an unnatural daughter&mdash;that's all
      I've got to say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bell took his hat and went out&mdash;a conclusive form of punctuation
      much used by men in discussions of this sort.

      CHAPTER III. BREAKERS
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   Duck! Dive! Here comes another one!
   Wait till the crest-ruffles show!
   Beyond is smooth water in beauty and wonder&mdash;
   Shut your mouth!  Hold your breath!  Dip your head under!
   Dive through the weight and the wash, and the thunder&mdash;
   Look out for the undertow!
</pre>
    <p>
      If Diantha imagined that her arithmetical victory over a too-sordid
      presentation of the parental claim was a final one, she soon found herself
      mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is easy to say&mdash;putting an epic in an epigram&mdash;&ldquo;She seen her
      duty and she done it!&rdquo; but the space and time covered are generally as far
      beyond our plans as the estimates of an amateur mountain climber exceed
      his achievements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her determination was not concealed by her outraged family. Possibly they
      thought that if the matter was well aired, and generally discussed, the
      daring offender might reconsider. Well-aired it certainly was, and widely
      discussed by the parents of the little town before young people who sat in
      dumbness, or made faint defense. It was also discussed by the young
      people, but not before their parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had told Ross, first of all, meaning to have a quiet talk with him to
      clear the ground before arousing her own family; but he was suddenly away
      just as she opened the subject, by a man on a wheel&mdash;some wretched
      business about the store of course&mdash;and sent word that night that he
      could not come up again. Couldn't come up the next night either. Two long
      days&mdash;two long evenings without seeing him. Well&mdash;if she went
      away she'd have to get used to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had so many things to explain, so much to say to make it right
      with him; she knew well what a blow it was. Now it was all over town&mdash;and
      she had had no chance to defend her position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbors called. Tall bony Mrs. Delafield who lived nearest to them
      and had known Diantha for some years, felt it her duty to make a special
      appeal&mdash;or attack rather; and brought with her stout Mrs. Schlosster,
      whose ancestors and traditions were evidently of German extraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha retired to her room when she saw these two bearing down upon the
      house; but her mother called her to make a pitcher of lemonade for them&mdash;and
      having entered there was no escape. They harried her with questions, were
      increasingly offended by her reticence, and expressed disapproval with a
      fullness that overmastered the girl's self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have as much right to go into business as any other citizen, Mrs.
      Delafield,&rdquo; she said with repressed intensity. &ldquo;I am of age and live in a
      free country. What you say of children no longer applies to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is this mysterious business you're goin' into&mdash;if one may
      inquire? Nothin you're ashamed to mention, I hope?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Delafield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If a woman refuses to mention her age is it because she's ashamed of it?&rdquo;
       the girl retorted, and Mrs. Delafield flushed darkly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never have I heard such talk from a maiden to her elders,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Schlosster. &ldquo;In my country the young have more respect, as is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bell objected inwardly to any reprimand of her child by others; but
      she agreed to the principle advanced and made no comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha listened to quite a volume of detailed criticism, inquiry and
      condemnation, and finally rose to her feet with the stiff courtesy of the
      young.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must excuse me now,&rdquo; she said with set lips. &ldquo;I have some necessary
      work to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She marched upstairs, shut her bedroom door and locked it, raging
      inwardly. &ldquo;Its none of their business! Not a shadow! Why should Mother sit
      there and let them talk to me like that! One would think childhood had no
      limit&mdash;unless it's matrimony!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This reminded her of her younger sister's airs of superior wisdom, and did
      not conduce to a pleasanter frame of mind. &ldquo;With all their miserable
      little conventions and idiocies! And what 'they'll say,' and 'they'll
      think'! As if I cared! Minnie'll be just such another!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She heard the ladies going out, still talking continuously, a faint
      response from her mother now and then, a growing quiet as their steps
      receded toward the gate; and then another deeper voice took up the theme
      and heavily approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the minister! Diantha dropped into her rocker and held the arms
      tight. &ldquo;Now I'll have to take it again I suppose. But he ought to know me
      well enough to understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diantha!&rdquo; called her mother, &ldquo;Here's Dr. Major;&rdquo; and the girl washed her
      face and came down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Major was a heavy elderly man with a strong mouth and a warm hand
      clasp. &ldquo;What's all this I hear about you, young lady?&rdquo; he demanded,
      holding her hand and looking her straight in the eye. &ldquo;Is this a new kind
      of Prodigal Daughter we're encountering?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not look nor sound condemnatory, and as she faced him she caught a
      twinkle in the wise old eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can call it that if you want to,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Only I thought the
      Prodigal Son just spent his money&mdash;I'm going to earn some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to talk to Diantha, Doctor Major,&rdquo; Mrs. Bell struck in. &ldquo;I'm
      going to ask you to excuse me, and go and lie down for a little. I do
      believe she'll listen to you more than to anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother retired, feeling sure that the good man who had known her
      daughter for over fifteen years would have a restraining influence now;
      and Diantha braced herself for the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came, heavy and solid, based on reason, religion, tradition, the custom
      of ages, the pastoral habit of control and protection, the father's
      instinct, the man's objection to a girl's adventure. But it was courteous,
      kind, and rationally put, and she met it point by point with the
      whole-souled arguments of a new position, the passionate enthusiasm of her
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      They called a truce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see that you <i>think</i> its your duty, young, woman&mdash;that's
      the main thing. I think you're wrong. But what you believe to be right you
      have to do. That's the way we learn my dear, that's the way we learn! Well&mdash;you've
      been a good child ever since I've known you. A remarkably good child. If
      you have to sow this kind of wild oats&mdash;&rdquo; they both smiled at this,
      &ldquo;I guess we can't stop you. I'll keep your secret&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its not a secret really,&rdquo; the girl explained, &ldquo;I'll tell them as soon as
      I'm settled. Then they can tell&mdash;if they want to.&rdquo; And they both
      smiled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I won't tell till I hear of it then. And&mdash;yes, I guess I
      can furnish that document with a clean conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave him paper and pen and he wrote, with a grin, handing her the
      result.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read it, a girlish giggle lightening the atmosphere. &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; she
      said earnestly. &ldquo;Thank you ever so much. I knew you would help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you get stuck anywhere just let me know,&rdquo; he said rising. &ldquo;This Proddy
      Gal may want a return ticket yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll walk first!&rdquo; said Diantha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Dr. Major,&rdquo; cried her mother from the window, &ldquo;Don't go! We want you to
      stay to supper of course!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had other calls to make, he said, and went away, his big hands
      clasped behind him; his head bent, smiling one minute and shaking his head
      the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha leaned against a pearly eucalyptus trunk and watched him. She
      would miss Dr. Major. But who was this approaching? Her heart sank
      miserably. Mrs. Warden&mdash;and <i>all</i> the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to meet them&mdash;perforce. Mrs. Warden had always been kind and
      courteous to her; the girls she had not seen very much of, but they had
      the sweet Southern manner, were always polite. Ross's mother she must
      love. Ross's sisters too&mdash;if she could. Why did the bottom drop out
      of her courage at sight of them?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear child!&rdquo; said Mrs. Warden, kissing her. &ldquo;I know just how you
      feel! You want to help my boy! That's your secret! But this won't do it,
      my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've no idea how badly Ross feels!&rdquo; said Madeline. &ldquo;Mrs. Delafield
      dropped in just now and told us. You ought to have seen him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't believe it of course,&rdquo; Adeline put in. &ldquo;And he wouldn't say a
      thing&mdash;not a thing to blame you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We said we'd come over right off&mdash;and tried to bring him&mdash;but
      he said he'd got to go back to the store,&rdquo; Coraline explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was mad though!&rdquo; said Dora&mdash;&ldquo;<i>I</i> know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha looked from one to the other helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in! Come in!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bell hospitably. &ldquo;Have this rocker, Mrs.
      Warden&mdash;wouldn't you like some cool drink? Diantha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed!&rdquo; Mrs. Warden protested. &ldquo;Don't get a thing. We're going right
      back, it's near supper time. No, we can't think of staying, of course not,
      no indeed!&mdash;But we had to come over and hear about this dear child's
      idea!&mdash;Now tell us all about it, Diantha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There they sat&mdash;five pairs of curious eyes&mdash;and her mother's sad
      ones&mdash;all kind&mdash;all utterly incapable of understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moistened her lips and plunged desperately. &ldquo;It is nothing dreadful,
      Mrs. Warden. Plenty of girls go away to earn their livings nowadays. That
      is all I'm doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why go away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you were earning your living before!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't teaching earning your living?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>are</i> you going to do?&rdquo; the girls protested variously, and Mrs.
      Warden, with a motherly smile, suggested!!!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That doesn't explain your wanting to leave Ross, my dear&mdash;and your
      mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to leave them,&rdquo; protested Diantha, trying to keep her voice
      steady. &ldquo;It is simply that I have made up my mind I can do better
      elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what better?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Warden with sweet patience, which reduced
      Diantha to the bald statement, &ldquo;Earn more money in less time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is that better than staying with your mother and your lover?&rdquo; pursued
      the gentle inquisitor; while the girls tried, &ldquo;What do you want to earn
      more money for?&rdquo; and &ldquo;I thought you earned a lot before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Diantha did not wish to state in so many words that she wanted more
      money in order to marry sooner&mdash;she had hardly put it to herself that
      way. She could not make them see in a few moments that her plan was to do
      far more for her mother than she would otherwise ever be able to. And as
      to making them understand the larger principles at stake&mdash;the range
      and depth of her full purpose&mdash;that would be physically impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry!&rdquo; she said with trembling lips. &ldquo;I am extremely sorry. But&mdash;I
      cannot explain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Warden drew herself up a little. &ldquo;Cannot explain to me?&mdash;Your
      mother, of course, knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diantha is naturally more frank with me than with&mdash;anyone,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Bell proudly, &ldquo;But she does not wish her&mdash;business&mdash;plans&mdash;made
      public at present!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her daughter looked at her with vivid gratitude, but the words &ldquo;made
      public&rdquo; were a little unfortunate perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Mrs. Warden agreed, with her charming smile, &ldquo;that we can
      quite understand. I'm sure I should always wish my girls to feel so.
      Madeline&mdash;just show Mrs. Bell that necktie you're making&mdash;she
      was asking about the stitch, you remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The necktie was produced and admired, while the other girls asked Diantha
      if she had her fall dressmaking done yet&mdash;and whether she found wash
      ribbon satisfactory. And presently the whole graceful family withdrew,
      only Dora holding her head with visible stiffness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha sat on the floor by her mother, put her head in her lap and cried.
      &ldquo;How splendid of you, Mother!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;How simply splendid! I will
      tell you now&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;you won't tell even Father&mdash;yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear child&rdquo; said her Mother, &ldquo;I'd rather not know in that case. It is&mdash;easier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I kept still for!&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;It's hard enough, goodness
      knows&mdash;as it is! Its nothing wicked, or even risky, Mother dear&mdash;and
      as far as I can see it is right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother smiled through her tears. &ldquo;If you say that, my dear child, I
      know there's no stopping you. And I hate to argue with you&mdash;even for
      your own sake, because it is so much to my advantage to have you here. I&mdash;shall
      miss you&mdash;Diantha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't, Mother!&rdquo; sobbed the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its natural for the young to go. We expect it&mdash;in time. But you are
      so young yet&mdash;and&mdash;well, I had hoped the teaching would satisfy
      you till Ross was ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha sat up straight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother! can't you see Ross'll never be ready! Look at that family! And
      the way they live! And those mortgages! I could wait and teach and save a
      little even with Father always losing money; but I can't see Ross wearing
      himself out for years and years&mdash;I just <i>can't</i> bear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother stroked her fair hair softly, not surprised that her own plea
      was so lost in thought of the brave young lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; the girl went on &ldquo;If I waited&mdash;and saved&mdash;and
      married Ross&mdash;what becomes of <i>you,</i> I'd like to know? What I
      can't stand is to have you grow older and sicker&mdash;and never have any
      good time in all your life!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bell smiled tenderly. &ldquo;You dear child!&rdquo; she said; as if an
      affectionate five-year old had offered to get her a rainbow, &ldquo;I know you
      mean it all for the best. But, O my <i>dearest</i>! I'd rather have you&mdash;here&mdash;at
      home with me&mdash;-than any other 'good time' you can imagine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not see the suffering in her daughter's face; but she felt she
      had made an impression, and followed it up with heart-breaking sincerity.
      She caught the girl to her breast and held her like a little child. &ldquo;O my
      baby! my baby! Don't leave your mother. I can't bear it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A familiar step outside, heavy, yet uncertain, and they both looked at
      each other with frightened eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had forgotten the biscuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supper ready?&rdquo; asked Mr. Bell, with grim humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be in a moment, Father,&rdquo; cried Diantha springing to her feet. &ldquo;At
      least&mdash;in a few moments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't fret the child, Father,&rdquo; said Mrs. Henderson softly. &ldquo;She's feeling
      bad enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh'd think she would,&rdquo; replied her husband. &ldquo;Moreover&mdash;to my mind&mdash;she
      ought to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He got out the small damp local paper and his pipe, and composed himself
      in obvious patience: yet somehow this patience seemed to fill the kitchen,
      and to act like a ball and chain to Diantha's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got supper ready, at last, making griddle-cakes instead of biscuit,
      and no comment was made of the change: but the tension in the atmosphere
      was sharply felt by the two women; and possibly by the tall old man, who
      ate less than usual, and said absolutely nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going over to see Edwards about that new incubator,&rdquo; he said when the
      meal was over, and departed; and Mrs. Bell, after trying in vain to do her
      mending, wiped her clouded glasses and went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha made all neat and tidy; washed her own wet eyes again, and went
      out under the moon. In that broad tender mellow light she drew a deep
      breath and stretched her strong young arms toward the sky in dumb appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it would be hard,&rdquo; she murmured to herself, &ldquo;That is I knew the
      facts&mdash;but I didn't know the feeling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood at the gate between the cypresses, sat waiting under the acacia
      boughs, walked restlessly up and down the path outside, the dry pepper
      berries crush softly under foot; bracing herself for one more struggle&mdash;and
      the hardest of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will understand!&rdquo; he told herself, over and over, but at the bottom of
      her heart she knew he wouldn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came at last; a slower, wearier step than usual; came and took both her
      hands in his and stood holding them, looking at her questioningly. Then he
      held her face between his palms and made her look at him. Her eyes were
      brave and steady, but the mouth trembled in spite of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stilled it with a kiss, and drew her to a seat on the bench beside him.
      &ldquo;My poor Little Girl! You haven't had a chance yet to really tell me about
      this thing, and I want you to right now. Then I'm going to kill about
      forty people in this town! <i>Somebody</i> has been mighty foolish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She squeezed his hand, but found it very difficult to speak. His love, his
      sympathy, his tenderness, were so delicious after this day's trials&mdash;and
      before those further ones she could so well anticipate. She didn't wish to
      cry any more, that would by no means strengthen her position, and she
      found she couldn't seem to speak without crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One would think to hear the good people of this town that you were about
      to leave home and mother for&mdash;well, for a trip to the moon!&rdquo; he
      added. &ldquo;There isn't any agreement as to what you're going to do, but
      they're unanimous as to its being entirely wrong. Now suppose you tell me
      about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Diantha. &ldquo;I began to the other night, you know, you first
      of course&mdash;it was too bad! your having to go off at that exact
      moment. Then I had to tell mother&mdash;because&mdash;well you'll see
      presently. Now dear&mdash;just let me say it <i>all</i>&mdash;before you&mdash;do
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say away, my darling. I trust you perfectly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flashed a grateful look at him. &ldquo;It is this way, my dear. I have two,
      three, yes four, things to consider:&mdash;My own personal problem&mdash;my
      family's&mdash;yours&mdash;and a social one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My family's?&rdquo; he asked, with a faint shade of offence in his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No no dear&mdash;your own,&rdquo; she explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better cut mine out, Little Girl,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll consider that myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I won't talk about it if you don't want me to. There are the
      other three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't question your second, nor your imposing third, but isn't the
      first one&mdash;your own personal problem&mdash;a good deal answered?&rdquo; he
      suggested, holding her close for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can't talk straight when you put it that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose hurriedly and took a step or two up and down. &ldquo;I don't suppose&mdash;in
      spite of your loving me, that I can make you see it as I do. But I'll be
      just as clear as I can. There are some years before us before we can be
      together. In that time I intend to go away and undertake a business I am
      interested in. My purpose is to&mdash;develop the work, to earn money, to
      help my family, and to&mdash;well, not to hinder you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand, I confess,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don't you propose to tell me
      what this 'work' is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I will&mdash;certainly. But not yet dear! Let me try to show
      you how I feel about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;One thing I want to be sure of. Are you doing this with
      any quixotic notion of helping me&mdash;in <i>my</i> business? Helping me
      to take care of my family? Helping me to&mdash;&rdquo; he stood up now, looking
      very tall and rather forbidding, &ldquo;No, I won't say that to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would there be anything wrong in my meaning exactly that?&rdquo; she asked,
      holding her own head a little higher; &ldquo;both what you said and what you
      didn't?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be absolutely wrong, all of it,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I cannot believe
      that the woman I love would&mdash;could take such a position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Ross!&rdquo; said the girl earnestly. &ldquo;Suppose you knew where there
      was a gold mine&mdash;<i>knew it</i>&mdash;and by going away for a few
      years you could get a real fortune&mdash;wouldn't you do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally I should,&rdquo; he agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, suppose it wasn't a gold mine, but a business, a new system like
      those cigar stores&mdash;or&mdash;some patent amusement specialty&mdash;or
      <i>anything</i>&mdash;that you knew was better than what you're doing&mdash;wouldn't
      you have a right to try it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I should&mdash;but what has that to do with this case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why it's the same thing! Don't you see? I have plans that will be of real
      benefit to all of us, something worth while to <i>do</i>&mdash;and not
      only for us but for <i>everybody</i>&mdash;a real piece of progress&mdash;and
      I'm going to leave my people&mdash;and even you!&mdash;for a little while&mdash;to
      make us all happier later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled lovingly at her but shook his head slowly. &ldquo;You dear, brave,
      foolish child!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don't for one moment doubt your noble
      purposes. But you don't get the man's point of view&mdash;naturally.
      What's more you don't seem to get the woman's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you see no other point of view than those?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no others,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Come! come! my darling, don't add
      this new difficulty to what we've got to carry! I know you have a hard
      time of it at home. Some day, please God, you shall have an easier one!
      And I'm having a hard time too&mdash;I don't deny it. But you are the
      greatest joy and comfort I have, dear&mdash;you know that. If you go away&mdash;it
      will be harder and slower and longer&mdash;that's all. I shall have you to
      worry about too. Let somebody else do the gold-mine, dear&mdash;you stay
      here and comfort your Mother as long as you can&mdash;and me. How can I
      get along without you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He tried to put his arm around her again, but she drew back. &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;If I deliberately do what I think is right&mdash;against your
      wishes&mdash;what will you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; The laughed bitterly. &ldquo;What can I do? I'm tied by the leg here&mdash;I
      can't go after you. I've nothing to pull you out of a scrape with if you
      get in one. I couldn't do anything but&mdash;stand it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if I go ahead, and do what you don't like&mdash;and make you&mdash;suffer&mdash;would
      you&mdash;would you rather be free?&rdquo; Her voice was very low and shaken,
      but he heard her well enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Free of you? Free of <i>you</i>?&rdquo; He caught her and held her and kissed
      her over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mine!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You have given yourself to me! You cannot leave
      me. Neither of us is free&mdash;ever again.&rdquo; But she struggled away from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both of us are free&mdash;to do what we think right, <i>always</i> Ross!
      I wouldn't try to stop you if you thought it was your duty to go to the
      North Pole!&rdquo; She held him a little way off. &ldquo;Let me tell you, dear. Sit
      down&mdash;let me tell you all about it.&rdquo; But he wouldn't sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I want to know the details,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It doesn't much
      matter what you're going to do&mdash;if you really go away. I can't stop
      you&mdash;I see that. If you think this thing is your 'duty' you'll do it
      if it kills us all&mdash;and you too! If you have to go&mdash;I shall do
      nothing&mdash;can do nothing&mdash;but wait till you come back to me!
      Whatever happens, darling&mdash;no matter how you fail&mdash;don't ever be
      afraid to come back to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He folded his arms now&mdash;did not attempt to hold her&mdash;gave her
      the freedom she asked and promised her the love she had almost feared to
      lose&mdash;and her whole carefully constructed plan seemed like a child's
      sand castle for a moment; her heroic decision the wildest folly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not even looking at her; she saw his strong, clean-cut profile dark
      against the moonlit house, a settled patience in its lines. Duty! Here was
      duty, surely, with tenderest happiness. She was leaning toward him&mdash;her
      hand was seeking his, when she heard through the fragrant silence a sound
      from her mother's room&mdash;the faint creak of her light rocking chair.
      She could not sleep&mdash;she was sitting up with her trouble, bearing it
      quietly as she had so many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The quiet everyday tragedy of that distasteful life&mdash;the slow
      withering away of youth and hope and ambition into a gray waste of
      ineffectual submissive labor&mdash;not only of her life, but of thousands
      upon thousands like her&mdash;it all rose up like a flood in the girl's
      hot young heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross had turned to her&mdash;was holding out his arms to her. &ldquo;You won't
      go, my darling!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going Wednesday on the 7.10,&rdquo; said Diantha.

      CHAPTER IV. A CRYING NEED
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Lovest thou me?&rdquo; said the Fair Ladye;
    And the Lover he said, &ldquo;Yea!&rdquo;
    &ldquo;Then climb this tree&mdash;for my sake,&rdquo; said she,
    &ldquo;And climb it every day!&rdquo;
    So from dawn till dark he abrazed the bark
    And wore his clothes away;
   Till, &ldquo;What has this tree to do with thee?&rdquo;
     The Lover at last did say.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was a poor dinner. Cold in the first place, because Isabel would wait
      to thoroughly wash her long artistic hands; and put on another dress. She
      hated the smell of cooking in her garments; hated it worse on her white
      fingers; and now to look at the graceful erect figure, the round throat
      with the silver necklace about it, the soft smooth hair, silver-filletted,
      the negative beauty of the dove-colored gown, specially designed for home
      evenings, one would never dream she had set the table so well&mdash;and
      cooked the steak so abominably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel was never a cook. In the many servantless gaps of domestic life in
      Orchardina, there was always a strained atmosphere in the Porne household.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Porne, &ldquo;might I petition to have the steak less cooked? I
      know you don't like to do it, so why not shorten the process?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I always forget about the steak from one time
      to the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet we've had it three times this week, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you liked it better than anything,&rdquo; she with marked gentleness.
      &ldquo;I'll get you other things&mdash;oftener.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a shame you should have this to do, Isabel. I never meant you should
      cook for me. Indeed I didn't dream you cared so little about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I never dreamed you cared so much about it,&rdquo; she replied, still with
      repression. &ldquo;I'm not complaining, am I? I'm only sorry you should be
      disappointed in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not <i>you,</i> dear girl! You're all right! It's just this
      everlasting bother. Can't you get <i>anybody</i> that will stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't seem to get anybody on any terms, so far. I'm going again,
      to-morrow. Cheer up, dear&mdash;the baby keeps well&mdash;that's the main
      thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat on the rose-bowered porch and smoked while she cleared the table.
      At first he had tried to help her on these occasions, but their methods
      were dissimilar and she frankly told him she preferred to do it alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she slipped off the silk and put on the gingham again, washed the
      dishes with the labored accuracy of a trained mind doing unfamiliar work,
      made the bread, redressed at last, and joined him about nine o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too late to go anywhere, I suppose?&rdquo; he ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and I'm too tired. Besides&mdash;we can't leave Eddie alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes&mdash;I forget. Of course we can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand stole out to take hers. &ldquo;I <i>am</i> sorry, dear. It's awfully
      rough on you women out here. How do they all stand it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of them stand it much better than I do, Ned. You see they don't want
      to be doing anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. That's the mischief of it!&rdquo; he agreed; and she looked at him in the
      clear moonlight, wondering exactly what he thought the mischief was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go in and read a bit?&rdquo; he offered; but she thought not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm too tired, I'm afraid. And Eddie'll wake up as soon as we begin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they sat awhile enjoying the soft silence, and the rich flower scents
      about them, till Eddie did wake presently, and Isabel went upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She slept little that night, lying quite still, listening to her husband's
      regular breathing so near her, and the lighter sound from the crib. &ldquo;I am
      a very happy woman,&rdquo; she told herself resolutely; but there was no
      outpouring sense of love and joy. She knew she was happy, but by no means
      felt it. So she stared at the moon shadows and thought it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had planned the little house herself, with such love, such hope, such
      tender happy care! Not her first work, which won high praise in the school
      in Paris, not the prize-winning plan for the library, now gracing
      Orchardina's prettiest square, was as dear to her as this most womanly
      task&mdash;the making of a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the library success which brought her here, fresh from her foreign
      studies, and Orchardina accepted with western cordiality the youth and
      beauty of the young architect, though a bit surprised at first that &ldquo;I. H.
      Wright&rdquo; was an Isabel. In her further work of overseeing the construction
      of that library, she had met Edgar Porne, one of the numerous eager young
      real estate men of that region, who showed a liberal enthusiasm for the
      general capacity of women in the professions, and a much warmer feeling
      for the personal attractions of this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they chose the lot on pepper-shaded Inez Avenue; together they
      watched the rising of the concrete walls and planned the garden walks and
      seats, and the tiny precious pool in the far corner. He was so
      sympathetic! so admiring! He took as much pride in the big &ldquo;drawing room&rdquo;
       on the third floor as she did herself. &ldquo;Architecture is such fine work to
      do at home!&rdquo; they had both agreed. &ldquo;Here you have your north light&mdash;your
      big table&mdash;plenty of room for work! You will grow famouser and
      famouser,&rdquo; he had lovingly insisted. And she had answered, &ldquo;I fear I shall
      be too contented, dear, to want to be famous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was only some year and a-half ago,&mdash;but Isabel, lying there by
      her sleeping husband and sleeping child, was stark awake and only by
      assertion happy. She was thinking, persistently, of dust. She loved a
      delicate cleanliness. Her art was a precise one, her studio a workshop of
      white paper and fine pointed hard pencils, her painting the mechanical
      perfection of an even wash of color. And she saw, through the floors and
      walls and the darkness, the dust in the little shaded parlor&mdash;two
      days' dust at least, and Orchardina is very dusty!&mdash;dust in the
      dining-room gathered since yesterday&mdash;the dust in the kitchen&mdash;she
      would not count time there, and the dust&mdash;here she counted it
      inexorably&mdash;the dust of eight days in her great, light workroom
      upstairs. Eight days since she had found time to go up there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lying there, wide-eyed and motionless, she stood outside in thought and
      looked at the house&mdash;as she used to look at it with him, before they
      were married. Then, it had roused every blessed hope and dream of wedded
      joy&mdash;it seemed a casket of uncounted treasures. Now, in this dreary
      mood, it seemed not only a mere workshop, but one of alien tasks,
      continuous, impossible, like those set for the Imprisoned Princess by bad
      fairies in the old tales. In thought she entered the well-proportioned
      door&mdash;the Gate of Happiness&mdash;and a musty smell greeted her&mdash;she
      had forgotten to throw out those flowers! She turned to the parlor&mdash;no,
      the piano keys were gritty, one had to clean them twice a day to keep that
      room as she liked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From room to room she flitted, in her mind, trying to recall the exquisite
      things they meant to her when she had planned them; and each one now
      opened glaring and blank, as a place to work in&mdash;and the work undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I were an abler woman!&rdquo; she breathed. And then her common sense and
      common honesty made her reply to herself: &ldquo;I am able enough&mdash;in my
      own work! Nobody can do everything. I don't believe Edgar'd do it any
      better than I do.&mdash;He don't have to!&rdquo;&mdash;and then such a wave of
      bitterness rushed over her that she was afraid, and reached out one hand
      to touch the crib&mdash;the other to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awakened instantly. &ldquo;What is it, Dear?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Too tired to sleep,
      you poor darling? But you do love me a little, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O <i>yes</i>!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I do. Of <i>course</i> I do! I'm just
      tired, I guess. Goodnight, Sweetheart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was late in getting to sleep and late in waking.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he finally sat down to the hurriedly spread breakfast-table, Mr.
      Porne, long coffeeless, found it a bit difficult to keep his temper.
      Isabel was a little stiff, bringing in dishes and cups, and paying no
      attention to the sounds of wailing from above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well if you won't I will!&rdquo; burst forth the father at last, and ran
      upstairs, returning presently with a fine boy of some eleven months, who
      ceased to bawl in these familiar arms, and contented himself, for the
      moment, with a teaspoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you going to feed him?&rdquo; asked Mr. Porne, with forced patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't time yet,&rdquo; she announced wearily. &ldquo;He has to have his bath
      first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; with a patience evidently forced farther, &ldquo;isn't it time to feed
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The oatmeal is burned again. You'll have to
      eat cornflakes. And&mdash;the cream is sour&mdash;the ice didn't come&mdash;or
      at least, perhaps I was out when it came&mdash;and then I forgot it..... I
      had to go to the employment agency in the morning!.... I'm sorry I'm so&mdash;so
      incompetent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; he commented drily. &ldquo;Are there any crackers for instance? And
      how about coffee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She brought the coffee, such as it was, and a can of condensed milk. Also
      crackers, and fruit. She took the baby and sat silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I come home to lunch?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you'd better not,&rdquo; she replied coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there to be any dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner will be ready at six-thirty, if I have to get it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have to get it yourself I'll allow for seven-thirty,&rdquo; said he,
      trying to be cheerful, though she seemed little pleased by it. &ldquo;Now don't
      take it so hard, Ellie. You are a first-class architect, anyhow&mdash;one
      can't be everything. We'll get another girl in time. This is just the
      common lot out here. All the women have the same trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most women seem better able to meet it!&rdquo; she burst forth. &ldquo;It's not my
      trade! I'm willing to work, I like to work, but I can't <i>bear</i>
      housework! I can't seem to learn it at all! And the servants will not do
      it properly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they know your limitations, and take advantage of them! But cheer
      up, dear. It's no killing matter. Order by phone, don't forget the ice,
      and I'll try to get home early and help. Don't cry, dear girl, I love you,
      even if you aren't a good cook! And you love me, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her till she had to smile back at him and give him a loving hug;
      but after he had gone, the gloom settled upon her spirits once more. She
      bathed the baby, fed him, put him to sleep; and came back to the table.
      The screen door had been left ajar and the house was buzzing with flies,
      hot, with a week's accumulating disorder. The bread she made last night in
      fear and trembling, was hanging fatly over the pans; perhaps sour already.
      She clapped it into the oven and turned on the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she stood, undetermined, looking about that messy kitchen while the
      big flies bumped and buzzed on the windows, settled on every dish, and
      swung in giddy circles in the middle of the room. Turning swiftly she shut
      the door on them. The dining-room was nearly as bad. She began to put the
      cups and plates together for removal; but set her tray down suddenly and
      went into the comparative coolness of the parlor, closing the dining-room
      door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was quite tired enough to cry after several nights of broken rest and
      days of constant discomfort and irritation; but a sense of rising anger
      kept the tears back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I love him!&rdquo; she said to herself aloud but softly, remembering
      the baby, &ldquo;And no doubt he loves me! I'm glad to be his wife! I'm glad to
      be a mother to his child! I'm glad I married him! But&mdash;<i>this</i> is
      not what he offered! And it's not what I undertook! He hasn't had to
      change his business!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She marched up and down the scant space, and then stopped short and
      laughed drily, continuing her smothered soliloquy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Do you love me?' they ask, and, 'I will make you happy!' they say; and
      you get married&mdash;and after that it's Housework!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't say, 'Will you be my Cook?' 'Will you be my Chamber maid?'
      'Will you give up a good clean well-paid business that you love&mdash;that
      has big hope and power and beauty in it&mdash;and come and keep house for
      me?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love him? I'd be in Paris this minute if I didn't! What has 'love' to do
      with dust and grease and flies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she did drop on the small sofa and cry tempestuously for a little
      while; but soon arose, fiercely ashamed of her weakness, and faced the
      day; thinking of the old lady who had so much to do she couldn't think
      what to first&mdash;so she sat down and made a pincushion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then&mdash;where to begin!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eddie will sleep till half-past ten&mdash;if I'm lucky. It's now nearly
      half-past nine,&rdquo; she meditated aloud. &ldquo;If I do the upstairs work I might
      wake him. I mustn't forget the bread, the dishes, the parlor&mdash;O those
      flies! Well&mdash;I'll clear the table first!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Stepping softly, and handling the dishes with slow care, she cleaned the
      breakfast table and darkened the dining-room, flapping out some of the
      flies with a towel. Then she essayed the parlor, dusting and arranging
      with undecided steps. &ldquo;It <i>ought</i> to be swept,&rdquo; she admitted to
      herself; &ldquo;I can't do it&mdash;there isn't time. I'll make it dark&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather plan a dozen houses!&rdquo; she fiercely muttered, as she fussed
      about. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I'd rather build 'em&mdash;than to keep one clean!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then were her hopes dashed by a rising wail from above. She sat quite
      still awhile, hoping against hope that he would sleep again; but he
      wouldn't. So she brought him down in full cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her low chair by the window she held him and produced bright and
      jingling objects from the tall workbasket that stood near by, sighing
      again as she glanced at its accumulated mending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Eddy grew calm and happy in her arms, but showed a growing interest
      in the pleasing materials produced for his amusement, and a desire for
      closer acquaintance. Then a penetrating odor filled the air, and with a
      sudden &ldquo;O dear!&rdquo; she rose, put the baby on the sofa, and started toward
      the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the doorbell rang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne stopped in her tracks and looked at the door. It remained
      opaque and immovable. She looked at the baby&mdash;who jiggled his spools
      and crowed. Then she flew to the oven and dragged forth the bread, not
      much burned after all. Then she opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A nice looking young woman stood before her, in a plain travelling suit,
      holding a cheap dress-suit case in one hand and a denim &ldquo;roll-bag&rdquo; in the
      other, who met her with a cheerful inquiring smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you Mrs. Edgar Porne?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; answered that lady, somewhat shortly, her hand on the doorknob,
      her ear on the baby, her nose still remorsefully in the kitchen, her eyes
      fixed sternly on her visitor the while; as she wondered whether it was
      literature, cosmetics, or medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was about to add that she didn't want anything, when the young lady
      produced a card from the Rev. Benjamin A. Miner, Mrs. Porne's particularly
      revered minister, and stated that she had heard there was a vacancy in her
      kitchen and she would like the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Introducing Mrs. D. Bell, well known to friends of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;&rdquo; said Mrs. Porne, reading the card without in the
      least grasping what it said. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then there was a dull falling sound followed by a sharp rising one,
      and she rushed into the parlor without more words.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she could hear and be heard again, she found Mrs. Bell seated in the
      shadowy little hall, serene and cool. &ldquo;I called on Mr. Miner yesterday
      when I arrived,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;with letters of introduction from my former
      minister, told him what I wanted to do, and asked him if he could suggest
      anyone in immediate need of help in this line. He said he had called here
      recently, and believed you were looking for someone. Here is the letter I
      showed him,&rdquo; and she handed Mrs. Porne a most friendly and appreciative
      recommendation of Miss D. Bell by a minister in Jopalez, Inca Co., stating
      that the bearer was fully qualified to do all kinds of housework,
      experienced, honest, kind, had worked seven years in one place, and only
      left it hoping to do better in Southern California.
    </p>
    <p>
      Backed by her own pastor's approval this seemed to Mrs. Porne fully
      sufficient. The look of the girl pleased her, though suspiciously above
      her station in manner; service of any sort was scarce and high in
      Orchardina, and she had been an agelong week without any. &ldquo;When can you
      come?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can stop now if you like,&rdquo; said the stranger. &ldquo;This is my baggage. But
      we must arrange terms first. If you like to try me I will come this week
      from noon to-day to noon next Friday, for seven dollars, and then if you
      are satisfied with my work we can make further arrangements. I do not do
      laundry work, of course, and don't undertake to have any care of the
      baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take care of my baby myself!&rdquo; said Mrs. Porne, thinking the new girl
      was presuming, though her manner was most gently respectful. But a week
      was not long, she was well recommended, and the immediate pressure in that
      kitchen where the harvest was so ripe and the laborers so few&mdash;&ldquo;Well&mdash;you
      may try the week,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'll show you your room. And what is your
      name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Bell.&rdquo;
     </p>

</pre>
    <p>
      When young Mrs. Weatherstone swept her trailing crepe from the automobile
      to her friend's door, it was opened by a quick, soft-footed maid with a
      pleasant face, who showed her into a parlor, not only cool and flower-lit,
      but having that fresh smell that tells of new-washed floors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne came flying down to meet her, with such a look of rest and
      comfort as roused instant notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Belle! I haven't seen you look so bright in ever so long. It must be
      the new maid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it&mdash;she's 'Bell' too&mdash;'Miss Bell' if you please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The visitor looked puzzled. &ldquo;Is she a&mdash;a friend?&rdquo; she ventured, not
      sure of her ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say she was! A friend in need! Sit here by the window, Viva&mdash;and
      I'll tell you all about it&mdash;as far as it goes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gaily recounted her climax of confusion and weariness, and the sudden
      appearance of this ministering angel. &ldquo;She arrived at about quarter of
      ten. I engaged her inside of five minutes. She was into a gingham gown and
      at work by ten o'clock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What promptness! And I suppose there was plenty to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne laughed unblushingly. &ldquo;There was enough for ten women it seemed
      to me! Let's see&mdash;it's about five now&mdash;seven hours. We have nine
      rooms, besides the halls and stairs, and my shop. She hasn't touched that
      yet. But the house is clean&mdash;<i>clean</i>! Smell it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took her guest out into the hall, through the library and dining-room,
      upstairs where the pleasant bedrooms stretched open and orderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said that if I didn't mind she'd give it a superficial general
      cleaning today and be more thorough later!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weatherstone looked about her with a rather languid interest. &ldquo;I'm
      very glad for you, Belle, dear&mdash;but&mdash;what an endless nuisance it
      all is&mdash;don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nuisance! It's slow death! to me at least,&rdquo; Mrs. Porne answered. &ldquo;But I
      don't see why you should mind. I thought Madam Weatherstone ran that&mdash;palace,
      of yours, and you didn't have any trouble at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, she runs it. I couldn't get along with her at all if she didn't.
      That's her life. It was my mother's too. Always fussing and fussing. Their
      houses on their backs&mdash;like snails!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't see why, with ten (or is it fifteen?) servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its twenty, I think. But my dear Belle, if you imagine that when you have
      twenty servants you have neither work nor care&mdash;come and try it
      awhile, that's all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a millionaire baby's ransom!&rdquo; answered Isabel promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me my drawing tools and plans and I'm happy&mdash;but this business&rdquo;&mdash;she
      swept a white hand wearily about&mdash;&ldquo;it's not my work, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you <i>enjoy</i> it, don't you&mdash;I mean having nice things?&rdquo;
       asked her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I enjoy it, but so does Edgar. Can't a woman enjoy her home,
      just as a man does, without running the shop? I enjoy ocean travel, but I
      don't want to be either a captain or a common sailor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weatherstone smiled, a little sadly. &ldquo;You're lucky, you have other
      interests,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How about our bungalow? have you got any farther?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne flushed. &ldquo;I'm sorry, Viva. You ought to have given it to
      someone else. I haven't gone into that workroom for eight solid days. No
      help, and the baby, you know. And I was always dog-tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, dear, there's no very great rush. You can get at it
      now, can't you&mdash;with this other Belle to the fore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's not Belle, bless you&mdash;she's 'Miss Bell.' It's her last name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weatherstone smiled her faint smile. &ldquo;Well&mdash;why not? Like a
      seamstress, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; That's what she said. &ldquo;If this labor was as important as that
      of seamstress or governess why not the same courtesy&mdash;Oh she's a most
      superior <i>and</i> opinionated young person, I can see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like her looks,&rdquo; admitted Mrs. Weatherstone, &ldquo;but can't we look over
      those plans again; there's something I wanted to suggest.&rdquo; And they went
      up to the big room on the third floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her shop and at her work Isabel Porne was a different woman. She was
      eager and yet calm; full of ideas and ideals, yet with a practical
      knowledge of details that made her houses dear to the souls of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed out in the new drawings the practical advantages of kitchen
      and pantry; the simple but thorough ventilation, the deep closets, till
      her friend fairly laughed at her. &ldquo;And you say you're not domestic!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a domestic architect, if you like,&rdquo; said Isabel; &ldquo;but not a domestic
      servant.&mdash;I'll remember what you say about those windows&mdash;it's a
      good idea,&rdquo; and she made a careful note of Mrs. Weatherstone's suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      That lady pushed the plans away from her, and went to the many cushioned
      lounge in the wide west window, where she sat so long silent that Isabel
      followed at last and took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you love him so much?&rdquo; she asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; was the surprising answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;Mr. Weatherstone,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not very much. But he was something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel was puzzled. &ldquo;I knew you so well in school,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and that
      gay year in Paris. You were always a dear, submissive quiet little thing&mdash;but
      not like this. What's happened Viva?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing that anybody can help,&rdquo; said her friend. &ldquo;Nothing that matters.
      What does matter, anyway? Fuss and fuss and fuss. Dress and entertain.
      Travel till you're tired, and rest till you're crazy! Then&mdash;when a
      real thing happens&mdash;there's all this!&rdquo; and she lifted her black
      draperies disdainfully. &ldquo;And mourning notepaper and cards and servant's
      livery&mdash;and all the things you mustn't do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel put an arm around her. &ldquo;Don't mind, dear&mdash;you'll get over this&mdash;you
      are young enough yet&mdash;the world is full of things to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Weatherstone only smiled her faint smile again. &ldquo;I loved another
      man, first,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A real one. He died. He never cared for me at all.
      I cared for nothing else&mdash;nothing in life. That's why I married
      Martin Weatherstone&mdash;not for his old millions&mdash;but he really
      cared&mdash;and I was sorry for him. Now he's dead. And I'm wearing this&mdash;and
      still mourning for the other one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isabel held her hand, stroked it softly, laid it against her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll feel differently in time, perhaps!&rdquo; said her visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe if you took hold of the house&mdash;if you ran things yourself,&rdquo;&mdash;ventured
      Mrs. Porne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weatherstone laughed. &ldquo;And turn out the old lady? You don't know her.
      Why she managed her son till he ran away from her&mdash;and after he got
      so rich and imported her from Philadelphia to rule over Orchardina in
      general and his household in particular, she managed that poor little
      first wife of his into her grave, and that wretched boy&mdash;he's the
      only person that manages her! She's utterly spoiled him&mdash;that was his
      father's constant grief. No, no&mdash;let her run the house&mdash;she
      thinks she owns it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's fond of you, isn't she?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Porne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O I guess so&mdash;if I let her have her own way. And she certainly saves
      me a great deal of trouble. Speaking of trouble, there they are&mdash;she
      said she'd stop for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the gate puffed the big car, a person in livery rang the bell, and Mrs.
      Weatherstone kissed her friend warmly, and passed like a heavy shadow
      along the rose-bordered path. In the tonneau sat a massive old lady in
      sober silks, with a set impassive countenance, severely correct in every
      feature, and young Mat Weatherstone, sulky because he had to ride with his
      grandmother now and then. He was not a nice young man.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Diantha found it hard to write her home letters, especially to Ross. She
      could not tell them of all she meant to do; and she must tell them of this
      part of it, at once, before they heard of it through others.
    </p>
    <p>
      To leave home&mdash;to leave school-teaching, to leave love&mdash;and &ldquo;go
      out to service&rdquo; did not seem a step up, that was certain. But she set her
      red lips tighter and wrote the letters; wrote them and mailed them that
      evening, tired though she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three letters came back quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother's answer was affectionate, patient, and trustful, though not
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sister's was as unpleasant as she had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>idea!</i>&rdquo; wrote Mrs. Susie. &ldquo;A girl with a good home to live in
      and another to look forward to&mdash;and able to earn money <i>respectably!</i>
      to go out and work like a common Irish girl! Why Gerald is so mortified he
      can't face his friends&mdash;and I'm as ashamed as I can be! My own
      sister! You must be <i>crazy</i>&mdash;simply <i>crazy!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was hard on them. Diantha had faced her own difficulties bravely
      enough; and sympathized keenly with her mother, and with Ross; but she had
      not quite visualized the mortification of her relatives. She found tears
      in her eyes over her mother's letter. Her sister's made her both sorry and
      angry&mdash;a most disagreeable feeling&mdash;as when you step on the cat
      on the stairs. Ross's letter she held some time without opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in her little upstairs room in the evening. She had swept,
      scoured, scalded and carbolized it, and the hospitally smell was now
      giving way to the soft richness of the outer air. The &ldquo;hoo! hoo!&rdquo; of the
      little mourning owl came to her ears through the whispering night, and
      large moths beat noiselessly against the window screen. She kissed the
      letter again, held it tightly to her heart for a moment, and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest: I have your letter with its&mdash;somewhat surprising&mdash;news.
      It is a comfort to know where you are, that you are settled and in no
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can readily imagine that this is but the preliminary to something else,
      as you say so repeatedly; and I can understand also that you are too wise
      to tell me all you mean to be beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be perfectly frank with you, Dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place I love you. I shall love you always, whatever you do.
      But I will not disguise from you that this whole business seems to me
      unutterably foolish and wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you expect by some mysterious process to &ldquo;develope&rdquo; and
      &ldquo;elevate&rdquo; this housework business; and to make money. I should not love
      you any better if you made a million&mdash;and I would not take money from
      you&mdash;you know that, I hope. If in the years we must wait before we
      can marry, you are happier away from me&mdash;working in strange kitchens&mdash;or
      offices&mdash;that is your affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not argue nor plead with you, Dear Girl; I know you think you are
      doing right; and I have no right, nor power, to prevent you. But if my
      wish were right and power, you would be here to-night, under the shadow of
      the acacia boughs&mdash;in my arms!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any time you feel like coming back you will be welcome, Dear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, Ross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any time she felt like coming back?
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha slipped down in a little heap by the bed, her face on the letter&mdash;her
      arms spread wide. The letter grew wetter and wetter, and her shoulders
      shook from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the hands were tight-clenched, and if you had been near enough you
      might have heard a dogged repetition, monotonous as a Tibetan prayer mill:
      &ldquo;It is right. It is right. It is right.&rdquo; And then. &ldquo;Help me&mdash;please!
      I need it.&rdquo; Diantha was not &ldquo;gifted in prayer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Porne came home that night he found the wifely smile which is
      supposed to greet all returning husbands quite genuinely in evidence. &ldquo;O
      Edgar!&rdquo; cried she in a triumphant whisper, &ldquo;I've got such a nice girl!
      She's just as neat and quick; you've no idea the work she's done today&mdash;it
      looks like another place already. But if things look queer at dinner don't
      notice it&mdash;for I've just given her her head. I was so tired, and baby
      bothered so, and she said that perhaps she could manage all by herself if
      I was willing to risk it, so I took baby for a car-ride and have only just
      got back. And I <i>think</i> the dinner's going to be lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was lovely. The dining-room was cool and flyless. The table was set
      with an assured touch. A few of Orchardina's ever ready roses in a glass
      bowl gave an air of intended beauty Mrs. Porne had had no time for.
    </p>
    <p>
      The food was well-cooked and well-served, and the attendance showed an
      intelligent appreciation of when people want things and how they want
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne quite glowed with exultation, but her husband gently suggested
      that the newness of the broom was visibly uppermost, and that such
      palpable perfections were probably accompanied by some drawbacks. But he
      liked her looks, he admitted, and the cooking would cover a multitude of
      sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this they rested, while the week went by. It was a full week, and a
      short one. Mrs. Porne, making hay while the sun shone, caught up a little
      in her sewing and made some conscience-tormenting calls.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Thursday night came around she was simply running over with
      information to give her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a talk as I have had with Miss Bell! She is so queer! But she's nice
      too, and it's all reasonable enough, what she says. You know she's studied
      this thing all out, and she knows about it&mdash;statistics and things. I
      was astonished till I found she used to teach school. Just think of it!
      And to be willing to work out! She certainly does her work beautiful, but&mdash;it
      doesn't seem like having a servant at all. I feel as if I&mdash;boarded
      with her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why she seemed to me very modest and unpresuming,&rdquo; put in Mr. Porne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O yes, she never presumes. But I mean the capable way she manages&mdash;I
      don't have to tell her one thing, nor to oversee, nor criticize. I spoke
      of it and she said, 'If I didn't understand the business I should have no
      right to undertake it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a new point of view, isn't it?&rdquo; asked her husband. &ldquo;Don't they
      usually make you teach them their trade and charge for the privilege?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course they do. But then she does have her disadvantages&mdash;as
      you said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she? What are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why she's so&mdash;rigid. I'll read you her&mdash;I don't know what to
      call it. She's written out a definite proposition as to her staying with
      us, and I want you to study it, it's the queerest thing I ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The document was somewhat novel. A clear statement of the hours of labor
      required in the position, the quality and amount of the different kinds of
      work; the terms on which she was willing to undertake it, and all prefaced
      by a few remarks on the status of household labor which made Mr. Porne
      open his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Miss Bell; &ldquo;The ordinary rate for labor in this state, unskilled
      labor of the ordinary sort, is $2.00 a day. This is in return for the
      simplest exertion of brute force, under constant supervision and
      direction, and involving no serious risk to the employer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Household labor calls for the practice of several distinct crafts, and,
      to be properly done, requires thorough training and experience. Its
      performer is not only in a position of confidence, as necessarily
      entrusted with the care of the employer's goods and with knowledge of the
      most intimate family relations; but the work itself, in maintaining the
      life and health of the members of the household, is of most vital
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In consideration of existing economic conditions, however, I am willing
      to undertake these intricate and responsible duties for a seven day week
      at less wages than are given the street-digger, for $1.50 a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, my dear!&rdquo; said Mr. Porne, laying down the paper, &ldquo;This
      young woman does appreciate her business! And we're to be let off easy at
      $45.00 a month, are we.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And feel under obligations at that!&rdquo; answered his wife. &ldquo;But you read
      ahead. It is most instructive. We shall have to ask her to read a paper
      for the Club!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'In further consideration of the conditions of the time, I am willing to
      accept part payment in board and lodging instead of cash. Such
      accommodations as are usually offered with this position may be rated at
      $17.00 a month.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O come now, don't we board her any better than that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I thought, and I asked her about it, and she explained that
      she could get a room as good for a dollar and a-half a week&mdash;she had
      actually made inquiries in this very town! And she could; really a better
      room, better furnished, that is, and service with it. You know I've always
      meant to get the girl's room fixed more prettily, but usually they don't
      seem to mind. And as to food&mdash;you see she knows all about the cost of
      things, and the materials she consumes are really not more than two
      dollars and a half a week, if they are that. She even made some figures
      for me to prove it&mdash;see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Porne had to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Breakfast. Coffee at thirty-five cents per pound, one cup, one cent.
      Oatmeal at fourteen cents per package, one bowl, one cent. Bread at five
      cents per loaf, two slices, one-half cent. Butter at forty cents per
      pound, one piece, one and a-half cents. Oranges at thirty cents per dozen,
      one, three cents. Milk at eight cents per quart, on oatmeal, one cent.
      Meat or fish or egg, average five cents. Total&mdash;thirteen cents.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There! And she showed me dinner and lunch the same way. I had no idea
      food, just the material, cost so little. It's the labor, she says that
      makes it cost even in the cheapest restaurant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Porne. &ldquo;And in the case of the domestic servant we
      furnish the materials and she furnishes the labor. She cooks her own food
      and waits on herself&mdash;naturally it wouldn't come high. What does she
      make it?&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

      that's only what an ordinary first-class cook charges, out here, without
      all this fuss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, Ned, but you know we think it's awful, and we're always
      telling about their getting their board and lodging clear&mdash;as if we
      gave'em that out of the goodness of our hearts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly, my dear. And this amazing and arithmetical young woman makes us
      feel as if we were giving her wampum instead of money&mdash;mere primitive
      barter of ancient days in return for her twentieth century services! How
      does she do her work&mdash;that's the main question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw anyone do it better, or quicker, or easier. That is, I
      thought it was easy till she brought me this paper. Just read about her
      work, and you'll feel as if we ought to pay her all your salary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Porne read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Labor performed, average ten hours a day, as follows: Preparation of food
      materials, care of fires, cooking, table service, and cleaning of dishes,
      utensils, towels, stove, etc., per meal&mdash;breakfast two hours, dinner
      three hours, supper or lunch one hour&mdash;six hours per day for food
      service. Daily chamber work and dusting, etc., one and one-half hours per
      day. Weekly cleaning for house of nine rooms, with halls, stairs, closets,
      porches, steps, walks, etc., sweeping, dusting, washing windows, mopping,
      scouring, etc., averaging two hours per day. Door service, waiting on
      tradesmen, and extras one-half hour per day. Total ten hours per day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sounds well. Does it take that much time every day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed! It would take me twenty!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You know the week I
      was here alone I never did half she does. Of course I had Baby, but then I
      didn't do the things. I guess when it doesn't take so long they just don't
      do what ought to be done. For she is quick, awfully quick about her work.
      And she's thorough. I suppose it ought to be done that way&mdash;but I
      never had one before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She keeps mighty fresh and bright-looking after these herculean labors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but then she rests! Her ten hours are from six-thirty a.m., when she
      goes into the kitchen as regularly as a cuckoo clock, to eight-thirty p.m.
      when she is all through and her kitchen looks like a&mdash;well it's as
      clean and orderly as if no one was ever in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten hours&mdash;that's fourteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, but she takes out four. She claims time to eat her meals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Preposterous!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half an hour apiece, and half an hour in the morning to rest&mdash;and
      two in the afternoon. Anyway she is out, two hours every afternoon, riding
      in the electric cars!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That don't look like a very hard job. Her day laborer doesn't get two
      hours off every afternoon to take excursions into the country!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I know that, but he doesn't begin so early, nor stop so late. She
      does her square ten hours work, and I suppose one has a right to time
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem dubious about that, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's just where it's awkward. I'm used to girls being in all the
      time, excepting their day out. You see I can't leave baby, nor always take
      him&mdash;and it interferes with my freedom afternoons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;can't you arrange with her somehow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See if you can. She says she will only give ten hours of time for a
      dollar and a half a day&mdash;tisn't but fifteen cents an hour&mdash;I
      have to pay a woman twenty that comes in. And if she is to give up her
      chance of sunlight and fresh air she wants me to pay her extra&mdash;by
      the hour. Or she says, if I prefer, she would take four hours every other
      day&mdash;and so be at home half the time. I said it was difficult to
      arrange&mdash;with baby, and she was very sympathetic and nice, but she
      won't alter her plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let her go, and get a less exacting servant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;she does her work so well! And it saves a lot, really. She
      knows all about marketing and things, and plans the meals so as to have
      things lap, and it's a comfort to have her in the house and feel so safe
      and sure everything will be done right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's your province, my dear. I don't profess to advise. But I
      assure you I appreciate the table, and the cleanness of everything, and
      the rested look in your eyes, dear girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slipped her hand into his affectionately. &ldquo;It does make a difference,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;I <i>could</i> get a girl for $20.00 and save nearly $2.60 a
      week&mdash;but you know what they are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do indeed,&rdquo; he admitted fervently. &ldquo;It's worth the money to have this
      thing done so well. I think she's right about the wages. Better keep her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&mdash;she'll only agree to stay six months even at this rate!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;keep her six months and be thankful. I thought she was too
      good to last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked over the offered contract again. It closed with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This agreement to hold for six months from date if mutually satisfactory.
      In case of disagreement two weeks' notice is to be given on either side,
      or two weeks' wages if preferred by the employer.&rdquo; It was dated, and
      signed &ldquo;Miss D. C. Bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with inward amusement and great display of penmanship they added &ldquo;Mrs.
      Isabel J. Porne,&rdquo; and the contract was made.

      CHAPTER VI. THE CYNOSURE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    It's a singular thing that the commonest place
     Is the hardest to properly fill;
    That the labor imposed on a full half the race
     Is so seldom performed with good will&mdash;
     To say nothing of knowledge or skill!

    What we ask of all women, we stare at in one,
     And tribute of wonderment bring;
    If this task of the million is once fitly done
     We all hold our hands up and sing!
     It's really a singular thing!
</pre>
    <p>
      Isabel Porne was a cautious woman, and made no acclaim over her new
      acquisition until its value was proven. Her husband also bided his time;
      and when congratulated on his improved appearance and air of contentment,
      merely vouchsafed that his wife had a new girl who could cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      To himself he boasted that he had a new wife who could love&mdash;so
      cheerful and gay grew Mrs. Porne in the changed atmosphere of her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is remarkable, Edgar,&rdquo; she said, dilating repeatedly on the peculiar
      quality of their good fortune. &ldquo;It's not only good cooking, and good
      waiting, and a clean house&mdash;cleaner than I ever saw one before; and
      it's not only the quietness, and regularity and economy&mdash;why the
      bills have gone down more than a third!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;even I noticed that,&rdquo; he agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what I enjoy the most is the <i>atmosphere,</i>&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;When
      I have to do the work, the house is a perfect nightmare to me!&rdquo; She leaned
      forward from her low stool, her elbows on her knees, her chin in her
      hands, and regarded him intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edgar! You know I love you. And I love my baby&mdash;I'm no unfeeling
      monster! But I can tell you frankly that if I'd had any idea of what
      housework was like I'd never have given up architecture to try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucky for me you hadn't!&rdquo; said he fondly. &ldquo;I know it's been hard for you,
      little girl. I never meant that you should give up architecture&mdash;that's
      a business a woman could carry on at home I thought, the designing part
      anyway. There's your 'drawing-room' and all your things&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, with reminiscent bitterness, &ldquo;there they are&mdash;and
      there they might have stayed, untouched&mdash;if Miss Bell hadn't come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Makes you call her &ldquo;Miss Bell&rdquo; all the time, does she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne laughed. &ldquo;Yes. I hated it at first, but she asked if I could
      give her any real reason why the cook should be called by her first name
      more than the seamstress or governess. I tried to say that it was shorter,
      but she smiled and said that in this case it was longer!&mdash;Her name is
      Diantha&mdash;I've seen it on letters. And it is one syllable longer.
      Anyhow I've got used to Miss Bell now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gets letters often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;very often&mdash;from Topolaya where she came from. I'm afraid
      she's engaged.&rdquo; Mrs. Porne sighed ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't doubt it!&rdquo; said Mr. Porne. &ldquo;That would account for her six
      months' arrangement! Well, my dear&mdash;make hay while the sun shines!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do!&rdquo; she boasted. &ldquo;Whole stacks! I've had a seamstress in, and got all
      my clothes in order and the baby's. We've had lot of dinner-parties and
      teas as you know&mdash;all my &ldquo;social obligations&rdquo; are cleared off! We've
      had your mother for a visit, and mine's coming now&mdash;and I wasn't
      afraid to have either of them! There's no fault to be found with my
      housekeeping now! And there are two things better than that&mdash;yes,
      three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best thing is to see you look so young and handsome and happy again,&rdquo;
       said her husband, with a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that's one. Another is that now I feel so easy and lighthearted
      I can love you and baby&mdash;as&mdash;as I <i>do!</i> Only when I'm tired
      and discouraged I can't put my hand on it somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded sympathetically. &ldquo;I know, dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I feel that way
      myself&mdash;sometimes. What's the other?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why that's best of all!&rdquo; she cried triumphantly. &ldquo;I can Work again! When
      Baby's asleep I get hours at a time; and even when he's awake I've fixed a
      place where he can play&mdash;and I can draw and plan&mdash;just as I used
      to&mdash;<i>better</i> than I used to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is even more to you than loving?&rdquo; he asked in a quiet inquiring
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's more because it means <i>both!</i>&rdquo; She leaned to him, glowing,
      &ldquo;Don't you see? First I had the work and loved it. Then you came&mdash;and
      I loved you&mdash;better! Then Baby came and I loved him&mdash;best? I
      don't know&mdash;you and baby are all one somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief interim and then she drew back, blushing richly. &ldquo;Now
      stop&mdash;I want to explain. When the housework got to be such a
      nightmare&mdash;and I looked forward to a whole lifetime of it and <i>no</i>
      improvement; then I just <i>ached</i> for my work&mdash;and couldn't do
      it! And then&mdash;why sometimes dear, I just wanted to run away!
      Actually! From <i>both</i> of you!&mdash;you see, I spent five years
      studying&mdash;I was a <i>real</i> architect&mdash;and it did hurt to see
      it go. And now&mdash;O now I've got It and You too, darling! <i>And</i>
      the Baby!&mdash;O I'm so happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks to the Providential Miss Bell,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If she'll stay I'll pay
      her anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The months went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peace, order, comfort, cleanliness and economy reigned in the Porne
      household, and the lady of the house blossomed into richer beauty and
      happiness; her contentment marred only by a sense of flying time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bell fulfilled her carefully specified engagement to the letter;
      rested her peaceful hour in the morning; walked and rode in the afternoon;
      familiarized herself with the length and breadth of the town; and visited
      continuously among the servants of the neighborhood, establishing a large
      and friendly acquaintance. If she wore rubber gloves about the rough work,
      she paid for them herself; and she washed and ironed her simple and pretty
      costumes herself&mdash;with the result that they stayed pretty for
      surprising periods.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote letters long and loving, to Ross daily; to her mother twice a
      week; and by the help of her sister's authority succeeded in maintaining a
      fairly competent servant in her deserted place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father was bound he wouldn't,&rdquo; her sister wrote her; &ldquo;but I stood right
      up to him, I can now I'm married!&mdash;and Gerald too&mdash;that he'd no
      right to take it out of mother even if he was mad with you. He made a fuss
      about your paying for the girl&mdash;but that was only showing off&mdash;<i>he</i>
      couldn't pay for her just now&mdash;that's certain. And she does very well&mdash;a
      good strong girl, and quite devoted to mother.&rdquo; And then she scolded
      furiously about her sister's &ldquo;working out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha knew just how hard it was for her mother. She had faced all sides
      of the question before deciding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother misses you badly, of course,&rdquo; Ross wrote her. &ldquo;I go in as
      often as I can and cheer her up a bit. It's not just the work&mdash;she
      misses you. By the way&mdash;so do I.&rdquo; He expressed his views on her new
      employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha used to cry over her letters quite often. But she would put them
      away, dry her eyes, and work on at the plans she was maturing, with grim
      courage. &ldquo;It's hard on them now,&rdquo; she would say to herself. &ldquo;Its hard on
      me&mdash;some. But we'll all be better off because of it, and not only us&mdash;but
      everybody!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the happy and unhappy households of the fair town buzzed in
      comment and grew green with envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In social circles and church circles and club circles, as also in domestic
      circles, it was noised abroad that Mrs. Edgar Porne had &ldquo;solved the
      servant question.&rdquo; News of this marvel of efficiency and propriety was
      discussed in every household, and not only so but in barber-shops and
      other downtown meeting places mentioned. Servants gathered it at
      dinner-tables; and Diantha, much amused, regathered it from her new
      friends among the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she keep on just the same?&rdquo; asked little Mrs. Ree of Mrs. Porne in
      an awed whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the same if not better. I don't even order the meals now, unless I
      want something especial. She keeps a calendar of what we've had to eat,
      and what belongs to the time of year, prices and things. When I used to
      ask her to suggest (one does, you know: it is so hard to think up a
      variety!), she'd always be ready with an idea, or remind me that we had
      had so and so two days before, till I asked her if she'd like to order,
      and she said she'd be willing to try, and now I just sit down to the table
      without knowing what's going to be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I should think that would interfere with your sense of freedom,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Ellen A Dankshire, &ldquo;A woman should be mistress of her own household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I am! I order whenever I specially want anything. But she really does
      it more&mdash;more scientifically. She has made a study of it. And the
      bills are very much lower.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think you are the luckiest woman alive!&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Ree. &ldquo;I wish
      I had her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many a woman wished she had her, and some, calling when they knew Mrs.
      Porne was out, or descending into their own kitchens of an evening when
      the strange Miss Bell was visiting &ldquo;the help,&rdquo; made flattering
      propositions to her to come to them. She was perfectly polite and
      agreeable in manner, but refused all blandishments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you getting at your present place&mdash;if I may ask?&rdquo; loftily
      inquired the great Mrs. Thaddler, ponderous and beaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is surely no objection to your asking, madam,&rdquo; she replied
      politely. &ldquo;Mrs. Porne will not mind telling you, I am sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; said the patronizing visitor, regarding her through her lorgnette.
      &ldquo;Very good. Whatever it is I'll double it. When can you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My engagement with Mrs. Porne is for six months,&rdquo; Diantha answered, &ldquo;and
      I do not wish to close with anyone else until that time is up. Thank you
      for your offer just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Peculiarly offensive young person!&rdquo; said Mrs. Thaddler to her husband.
      &ldquo;Looks to me like one of these literary imposters. Mrs. Porne will
      probably appear in the magazines before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thaddler instantly conceived a liking for the young person, &ldquo;sight
      unseen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha acquired quite a list of offers; places open to her as soon as she
      was free; at prices from her present seven dollars up to the proposed
      doubling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fourteen dollars a week and found!&mdash;that's not so bad,&rdquo; she
      meditated. &ldquo;That would mean over $650 clear in a year! It's a wonder to me
      girls don't try it long enough to get a start at something else. With even
      two or three hundred ahead&mdash;and an outfit&mdash;it would be easier to
      make good in a store or any other way. Well&mdash;I have other fish to
      fry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she pursued her way; and, with Mrs. Porne's permission&mdash;held a
      sort of girl's club in her spotless kitchen one evening a week during the
      last three months of her engagement. It was a &ldquo;Study and Amusement Club.&rdquo;
       She gave them short and interesting lessons in arithmetic, in simple
      dressmaking, in easy and thorough methods of housework. She gave them
      lists of books, referred them to articles in magazines, insidiously taught
      them to use the Public Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      They played pleasant games in the second hour, and grew well acquainted.
      To the eye or ear of any casual visitor it was the simplest and most
      natural affair, calculated to &ldquo;elevate labor&rdquo; and to make home happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha studied and observed. They brought her their poor confidences,
      painfully similar. Always poverty&mdash;or they would not be there. Always
      ignorance, or they would not stay there. Then either incompetence in the
      work, or inability to hold their little earnings&mdash;or both; and
      further the Tale of the Other Side&mdash;the exactions and restrictions of
      the untrained mistresses they served; cases of withheld wages; cases of
      endless requirements; cases of most arbitrary interference with their
      receiving friends and &ldquo;followers,&rdquo; or going out; and cases, common enough
      to be horrible, of insult they could only escape by leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no wages, of course&mdash;and no recommendation, when you leave like
      that&mdash;but what else can a girl do, if she's honest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Diantha learned, made friends and laid broad foundations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excellence of her cocking was known to many, thanks to the weekly
      &ldquo;entertainments.&rdquo; No one refused. No one regretted acceptance. Never had
      Mrs. Porne enjoyed such a sense of social importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the people she ever knew called on her afresh, and people she never
      knew called on her even more freshly. Not that she was directly
      responsible for it. She had not triumphed cruelly over her less happy
      friends; nor had she cried aloud on the street corners concerning her good
      fortune. It was not her fault, nor, in truth anyone's. But in a community
      where the &ldquo;servant question&rdquo; is even more vexed than in the country at
      large, where the local product is quite unequal to the demand, and where
      distance makes importation an expensive matter, the fact of one woman's
      having, as it appeared, settled this vexed question, was enough to give
      her prominence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ellen A. Dankshire, President of the Orchardina Home and Culture
      Club, took up the matter seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Mrs. Porne,&rdquo; said she, settling herself vigorously into a comfortable
      chair, &ldquo;I just want to talk the matter over with you, with a view to the
      club. We do not know how long this will last&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't speak of it!&rdquo; said Mrs. Porne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;and it behooves us to study the facts while we have them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much is involved!&rdquo; said little Mrs. Ree, the Corresponding Secretary,
      lifting her pale earnest face with the perplexed fine lines in it. &ldquo;We are
      all so truly convinced of the sacredness of the home duties!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you want me to do?&rdquo; asked their hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have that remarkable young woman address our club!&rdquo; Mrs.
      Dankshire announced. &ldquo;It is one case in a thousand, and must be studied!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So noble of her!&rdquo; said Mrs. Ree. &ldquo;You say she was really a
      school-teacher? Mrs. Thaddler has put it about that she is one of these
      dreadful writing persons&mdash;in disguise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porne. &ldquo;She is perfectly straightforward about it, and
      had the best of recommendations. She was a teacher, but it didn't agree
      with her health, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps there is a story to it!&rdquo; Mrs. Ree advanced; but Mrs. Dankshire
      disagreed with her flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young woman has a theory, I believe, and she is working it out. I
      respect her for it. Now what we want to ask you, Mrs. Porne, is this: do
      you think it would make any trouble for you&mdash;in the household
      relations, you know&mdash;if we ask her to read a paper to the Club? Of
      course we do not wish to interfere, but it is a remarkable opportunity&mdash;very.
      You know the fine work Miss Lucy Salmon has done on this subject; and Miss
      Frances Kellor. You know how little data we have, and how great, how
      serious, a question it is daily becoming! Now here is a young woman of
      brains and culture who has apparently grappled with the question; her
      example and influence must not be lost! We must hear from her. The public
      must know of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such an ennobling example!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Ree. &ldquo;It might lead numbers of
      other school-teachers to see the higher side of the home duties!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Furthermore,&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Dankshire, &ldquo;this has occured to me. Would it
      not be well to have our ladies bring with them to the meeting the more
      intelligent of their servants; that they might hear and see the&mdash;the
      dignity of household labor&mdash;so ably set forth?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it&mdash;wouldn't that be a&mdash;an almost dangerous experiment?&rdquo;
       urged Mrs. Ree; her high narrow forehead fairly creped with little
      wrinkles: &ldquo;She might&mdash;say something, you know, that they might&mdash;take
      advantage of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, my dear!&rdquo; replied Mrs. Dankshire. She was very fond of Mrs.
      Ree, but had small respect for her judgment. &ldquo;What could she say? Look at
      what she does! And how beautifully&mdash;how perfectly&mdash;she does it!
      I would wager now&mdash;<i>may</i> I try an experiment Mrs. Porne?&rdquo; and
      she stood up, taking out her handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porne, &ldquo;with pleasure! You won't find any!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dankshire climbed heavily upon a carefully selected chair and passed
      her large clean plain-hemmed handkerchief across the top of a picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; she proclaimed proudly from her eminence, and showed the
      cloth still white. &ldquo;That,&rdquo; she continued in ponderous descent, &ldquo;that is
      Knowledge, Ability and Conscience!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how she gets the time!&rdquo; breathed Mrs. Ree, shaking her head
      in awed amazement, and reflecting that she would not dare trust Mrs.
      Dankshire's handkerchief on her picture tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have her address the Club,&rdquo; the president repeated. &ldquo;It will do
      worlds of good. Let me see&mdash;a paper on&mdash;we might say 'On the
      True Nature of Domestic Industry.' How does that strike you, Mrs. Ree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admirable!&rdquo; said Mrs. Ree. &ldquo;So strong! so succinct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That certainly covers the subject,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porne. &ldquo;Why don't you ask
      her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will. We have come for that purpose. But we felt it right to ask you
      about it first,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dankshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I have no control over Miss Bell's movements, outside of working
      hours,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Porne. &ldquo;And I don't see that it would make any
      difference to our relations. She is a very self-poised young woman, but
      extremely easy to get along with. And I'm sure she could write a splendid
      paper. You'd better ask her, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you call her in?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Dankshire, &ldquo;or shall we go out to the
      kitchen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come right out; I'd like you to see how beautifully she keeps
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen was as clean as the parlor; and as prettily arranged. Miss
      Bell was making her preparation for lunch, and stopped to receive the
      visitors with a serenely civil air&mdash;as of a country store-keeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to meet you, Miss Bell, very glad indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Dankshire, shaking hands with her warmly. &ldquo;We have at heard so much of
      your beautiful work here, and we admire your attitude! Now would you be
      willing to give a paper&mdash;or a talk&mdash;to our club, the Home and
      Culture Club, some Wednesday, on The True Nature of Domestic Industry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ree took Miss Bell's hand with something of the air of a Boston
      maiden accosting a saint from Hindoostan. &ldquo;If you only would!&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;I am sure it would shed light on this great subject!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Bell smiled at them both and looked at Mrs. Porne inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be delighted to have you do it,&rdquo; said her employer. &ldquo;I know it
      would be very useful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any date set?&rdquo; asked Miss Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any Wednesday after February,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dankshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I will come on the first Wednesday in April. If anything
      should happen to prevent I will let you know in good season, and if you
      should wish to postpone or alter the program&mdash;should think better of
      the idea&mdash;just send me word. I shall not mind in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went away quite jubilant, Miss Bell's acceptance was announced
      officially at the next club-meeting, and the Home and Culture Club felt
      that it was fulfilling its mission.

      CHAPTER VII. HERESY AND SCHISM.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     You may talk about religion with a free and open mind,
      For ten dollars you may criticize a judge;
     You may discuss in politics the newest thing you find,
      And open scientific truth to all the deaf and blind,
     But there's one place where the brain must never budge!

     CHORUS.

     Oh, the Home is Utterly Perfect!
     And all its works within!
      To say a word about it&mdash;
      To criticize or doubt it&mdash;
      To seek to mend or move it&mdash;
      To venture to improve it&mdash;
     Is The Unpardonable Sin!

     &mdash;&ldquo;Old Song.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Mr. Porne took an afternoon off and came with his wife to hear their
      former housemaid lecture. As many other men as were able did the same. All
      the members not bedridden were present, and nearly all the guests they had
      invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      So many were the acceptances that a downtown hall had been taken; the
      floor was more than filled, and in the gallery sat a block of servant
      girls, more gorgeous in array than the ladies below whispering excitedly
      among themselves. The platform recalled a &ldquo;tournament of roses,&rdquo; and,
      sternly important among all that fragrant loveliness, sat Mrs. Dankshire
      in &ldquo;the chair&rdquo; flanked by Miss Torbus, the Recording Secretary, Miss
      Massing, the Treasurer, and Mrs. Ree, tremulous with importance in her
      official position. All these ladies wore an air of high emprise, even more
      intense than that with which they usually essayed their public duties.
      They were richly dressed, except Miss Torbus, who came as near it as she
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the side, and somewhat in the rear of the President, on a chair quite
      different from &ldquo;the chair,&rdquo; discreetly gowned and of a bafflingly serene
      demeanor, sat Miss Bell. All eyes were upon her&mdash;even some opera
      glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a good-looker anyhow,&rdquo; was one masculine opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a peach,&rdquo; was another, &ldquo;Tell you&mdash;the chap that gets her is
      well heeled!&rdquo; said a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies bent their hats toward one another and conferred in flowing
      whispers; and in the gallery eager confidences were exchanged, with
      giggles.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the small table before Mrs. Dankshire, shaded by a magnificent bunch of
      roses, lay that core and crux of all parliamentry dignity, the gavel; an
      instrument no self-respecting chairwoman may be without; yet which she
      still approaches with respectful uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of its large size and high social standing, the Orchardina Home
      and Culture Club contained some elements of unrest, and when the yearly
      election of officers came round there was always need for careful work in
      practical politics to keep the reins of government in the hands of &ldquo;the
      right people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thaddler, conscious of her New York millions, and Madam Weatherstone,
      conscious of her Philadelphia lineage, with Mrs. Johnston A. Marrow (&ldquo;one
      of the Boston Marrows!&rdquo; was awesomely whispered of her), were the heads of
      what might be called &ldquo;the conservative party&rdquo; in this small parliament;
      while Miss Miranda L. Eagerson, describing herself as 'a journalist,' who
      held her place in local society largely by virtue of the tacit dread of
      what she might do if offended&mdash;led the more radical element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the members were quite content to follow the lead of the solidly
      established ladies of Orchard Avenue; especially as this leadership
      consisted mainly in the pursuance of a masterly inactivity. When wealth
      and aristocracy combine with that common inertia which we dignify as
      &ldquo;conservatism&rdquo; they exert a powerful influence in the great art of sitting
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless there were many alert and conscientious women in this large
      membership, and when Miss Eagerson held the floor, and urged upon the club
      some active assistance in the march of events, it needed all Mrs.
      Dankshire's generalship to keep them content with marking time.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this auspicious occasion, however, both sides were agreed in interest
      and approval. Here was a subject appealing to every woman present, and
      every man but such few as merely &ldquo;boarded&rdquo;; even they had memories and
      hopes concerning this question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Solemnly rose Mrs. Dankshire, her full silks rustling about her, and let
      one clear tap of the gavel fall into the sea of soft whispering and
      guttural murmurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the silence that followed she uttered the momentous announcements: &ldquo;The
      meeting will please come to order,&rdquo; &ldquo;We will now hear the reading of the
      minutes of the last meeting,&rdquo; and so on most conscientiously through
      officer's reports and committees reports to &ldquo;new business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it is their more frequent practice of religious rites, perhaps
      their devout acceptance of social rulings and the dictates of fashion,
      perhaps the lifelong reiterance of small duties at home, or all these
      things together, which makes women so seriously letter-perfect in
      parliamentry usage. But these stately ceremonies were ended in course of
      time, and Mrs. Dankshire rose again, even more solemn than before, and
      came forward majestically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Members&mdash;-and guests,&rdquo; she said impressively, &ldquo;this is an occasion
      which brings pride to the heart of every member of the Home and Culture
      Club. As our name implies, this Club is formed to serve the interests of
      The Home&mdash;those interests which stand first, I trust, in every human
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A telling pause, and the light patter of gloved hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Its second purpose,&rdquo; pursued the speaker, with that measured delivery
      which showed that her custom, as one member put it, was to &ldquo;first write
      and then commit,&rdquo; &ldquo;is to promote the cause of Culture in this community.
      Our aim is Culture in the broadest sense, not only in the curricula of
      institutions of learning, not only in those spreading branches of study
      and research which tempts us on from height to height&rdquo;&mdash;(&ldquo;proof of
      arboreal ancestry that,&rdquo; Miss Eagerson confided to a friend, whose choked
      giggle attracted condemning eyes)&mdash;&ldquo;but in the more intimate fields
      of daily experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most of us, however widely interested in the higher education, are still&mdash;and
      find in this our highest honor&mdash;wives and mothers.&rdquo; These novel
      titles called forth another round of applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As such,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Dankshire, &ldquo;we all recognize the difficult&mdash;the
      well-nigh insuperable problems of the&rdquo;&mdash;she glanced at the gallery
      now paying awed attention&mdash;&ldquo;domestic question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know how on the one hand our homes yawn unattended&rdquo;&mdash;(&ldquo;I yawn
      while I'm attending&mdash;eh?&rdquo; one gentleman in the rear suggested to his
      neighbor)&mdash;&ldquo;while on the other the ranks of mercenary labor are
      overcrowded. Why is it that while the peace and beauty, the security and
      comfort, of a good home, with easy labor and high pay, are open to every
      young woman, whose circumstances oblige her to toil for her living, she
      blindly refuses these true advantages and loses her health and too often
      what is far more precious!&mdash;in the din and tumult of the factory, or
      the dangerous exposure of the public counter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madam Weatherstone was much impressed at this point, and beat her black
      fan upon her black glove emphatically. Mrs. Thaddler also nodded; which
      meant a good deal from her. The applause was most gratifying to the
      speaker, who continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fortunately for the world there are some women yet who appreciate the
      true values of life.&rdquo; A faint blush crept slowly up the face of Diantha,
      but her expression was unchanged. Whoso had met and managed a roomful of
      merciless children can easily face a woman's club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have with us on this occasion one, as we my say, our equal in birth
      and breeding,&rdquo;&mdash;Madam Weatherstone here looked painfully shocked as
      also did the Boston Marrow; possibly Mrs. Dankshire, whose parents were
      Iowa farmers, was not unmindful of this, but she went on smoothly, &ldquo;and
      whose first employment was the honored task of the teacher; who has
      deliberately cast her lot with the domestic worker, and brought her
      trained intelligence to bear upon the solution of this great question&mdash;The
      True Nature of Domestic Service. In the interests of this problem she has
      consented to address us&mdash;I take pleasure in introducing Miss Diantha
      Bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha rose calmly, stepped forward, bowed to the President and officers,
      and to the audience. She stood quietly for a moment, regarding the faces
      before her, and produced a typewritten paper. It was clear, short, and to
      some minds convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She set forth that the term &ldquo;domestic industry&rdquo; did not define certain
      kinds of labor, but a stage of labor; that all labor was originally
      domestic; but that most kinds had now become social, as with weaving and
      spinning, for instance, for centuries confined to the home and done by
      women only; now done in mills by men and women; that this process of
      socialization has now been taken from the home almost all the manufactures&mdash;as
      of wine, beer, soap, candles, pickles and other specialties, and part of
      the laundry work; that the other processes of cleaning are also being
      socialized, as by the vacuum cleaners, the professional window-washers,
      rug cleaners, and similar professional workers; and that even in the
      preparation of food many kinds are now specialized, as by the baker and
      confectioner. That in service itself we were now able to hire by the hour
      or day skilled workers necessarily above the level of the &ldquo;general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A growing rustle of disapproval began to make itself felt, which increased
      as she went on to explain how the position of the housemaid is a survival
      of the ancient status of woman slavery, the family with the male head and
      the group of servile women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The keynote of all our difficulty in this relation is that we demand
      celibacy of our domestic servants,&rdquo; said Diantha.
    </p>
    <p>
      A murmur arose at this statement, but she continued calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since it is natural for women to marry, the result is that our domestic
      servants consist of a constantly changing series of young girls,
      apprentices, as it were; and the complicated and important duties of the
      household cannot be fully mastered by such hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The audience disapproved somewhat of this, but more of what followed. She
      showed (Mrs. Porne nodding her head amusedly), that so far from being
      highly paid and easy labor, house service was exacting and responsible,
      involving a high degree of skill as well as moral character, and that it
      was paid less than ordinary unskilled labor, part of this payment being
      primitive barter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as whispers and sporadic little spurts of angry talk increased, the
      clear quiet voice went on to state that this last matter, the position of
      a strange young girl in our homes, was of itself a source of much of the
      difficulty of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We speak of giving them the safety and shelter of the home,&rdquo;&mdash;here
      Diantha grew solemn;&mdash;&ldquo;So far from sharing our homes, she gives up
      her own, and has none of ours, but the poorest of our food and a cramped
      lodging; she has neither the freedom nor the privileges of a home; and as
      to shelter and safety&mdash;the domestic worker, owing to her peculiarly
      defenceless position, furnishes a terrible percentage of the unfortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A shocked silence met this statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In England shop-workers complain of the old custom of 'sleeping in'&mdash;their
      employers furnishing them with lodging as part payment; this also is a
      survival of the old apprentice method. With us, only the domestic servant
      is held to this antiquated position.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of the chill displeasure about her she cheerfully pursued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us now consider the economic side of the question. 'Domestic economy'
      is a favorite phrase. As a matter of fact our method of domestic service
      is inordinately wasteful. Even where the wife does all the housework,
      without pay, we still waste labor to an enormous extent, requiring one
      whole woman to wait upon each man. If the man hires one or more servants,
      the wastes increase. If one hundred men undertake some common business,
      they do not divide in two halves, each man having another man to serve him&mdash;fifty
      productive laborers, and fifty cooks. Two or three cooks could provide for
      the whole group; to use fifty is to waste 47 per cent. of the labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But our waste of labor is as nothing to our waste of money. For, say
      twenty families, we have twenty kitchens with all their furnishings,
      twenty stoves with all their fuel; twenty cooks with all their wages; in
      cash and barter combined we pay about ten dollars a week for our cooks&mdash;$200
      a week to pay for the cooking for twenty families, for about a hundred
      persons!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three expert cooks, one at $20 a week and two at $15 would save to those
      twenty families $150 a week and give them better food. The cost of kitchen
      furnishings and fuel, could be reduced by nine-tenths; and beyond all that
      comes our incredible waste in individual purchasing. What twenty families
      spend on individual patronage of small retailers, could be reduced by more
      than half if bought by competent persons in wholesale quantities.
      Moreover, our whole food supply would rise in quality as well as lower in
      price if it was bought by experts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To what does all this lead?&rdquo; asked Diantha pleasantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody said anything, but the visible attitude of the house seemed to say
      that it led straight to perdition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The solution for which so many are looking is no new scheme of any sort;
      and in particular it is not that oft repeated fore-doomed failure called
      'co-operative housekeeping'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this a wave of relief spread perceptibly. The irritation roused by
      those preposterous figures and accusations was somewhat allayed. Hope was
      relit in darkened countenances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The inefficiency of a dozen tottering households is not removed by
      combining them,&rdquo; said Diantha. This was of dubious import. &ldquo;Why should we
      expect a group of families to &ldquo;keep house&rdquo; expertly and economically
      together, when they are driven into companionship by the fact that none of
      them can do it alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again an uncertain reception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every family is a distinct unit,&rdquo; the girl continued. &ldquo;Its needs are
      separate and should be met separately. The separate house and garden
      should belong to each family, the freedom and group privacy of the common
      milkman, by a common baker, by a common cooking and a common cleaning
      establishment. We are rapidly approaching an improved system of living in
      which the private home will no more want a cookshop on the premises than a
      blacksmith's shop or soap-factory. The necessary work of the kitchenless
      house will be done by the hour, with skilled labor; and we shall order our
      food cooked instead of raw. This will give to the employees a respectable
      well-paid profession, with their own homes and families; and to the
      employers a saving of about two-thirds of the expense of living, as well
      as an end of all our difficulties with the servant question. That is the
      way to elevate&mdash;to enoble domestic service. It must cease to be
      domestic service&mdash;and become world service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly and quietly she sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Eagerson was on her feet. So were others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam President! Madam President!&rdquo; resounded from several points at once.
      Madam Weatherstone&mdash;Mrs. Thaddler&mdash;no! yes&mdash;they really
      were both on their feet. Applause was going on&mdash;irregularly&mdash;soon
      dropped. Only, from the group in the gallery it was whole-hearted and
      consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dankshire, who had been growing red and redder as the paper advanced,
      who had conferred in alarmed whispers with Mrs. Ree, and Miss Massing, who
      had even been seen to extend her hand to the gavel and finger it
      threateningly, now rose, somewhat precipitately, and came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order, please! You will please keep order. You have heard the&mdash;we
      will now&mdash;the meeting is now open for discussion, Mrs. Thaddler!&rdquo; And
      she sat down. She meant to have said Madam Weatherstone, by Mrs. Thaddler
      was more aggressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to say,&rdquo; said that much beaded lady in a loud voice, &ldquo;that I was
      against this&mdash;unfortunate experiment&mdash;from the first. And I
      trust it will never be repeated!&rdquo; She sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two tight little dimples flickered for an instant about the corners of
      Diantha's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam Weatherstone?&rdquo; said the President, placatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madam Weatherstone arose, rather sulkily, and looked about her. An
      agitated assembly met her eye, buzzing universally each to each.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dankshire, &ldquo;ORDER, please!&rdquo; and rapped three times with
      the gavel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have attended many meetings, in many clubs, in many states,&rdquo; said Madam
      Weatherstone, &ldquo;and have heard much that was foolish, and some things that
      were dangerous. But I will say that never in the course of all my
      experience have I heard anything so foolish and so dangerous, as this. I
      trust that the&mdash;doubtless well meant&mdash;attempt to throw light on
      this subject&mdash;from the wrong quarter&mdash;has been a lesson to us
      all. No club could survive more than one such lamentable mistake!&rdquo; And she
      sat down, gathering her large satin wrap about her like a retiring Caesar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam President!&rdquo; broke forth Miss Eagerson. &ldquo;I was up first&mdash;and
      have been standing ever since&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Miss Eagerson,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dankshire superbly, &ldquo;The Rev. Dr.
      Eltwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Mrs. Dankshire supposed she was still further supporting the cause of
      condemnation she made a painful mistake. The cloth and the fine bearing of
      the young clergyman deceived her; and she forgot that he was said to be
      &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; and was new to the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come to the platform, Dr. Eltwood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Eltwood came to the platform with the easy air of one to whom
      platforms belonged by right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; he began in tones of cordial good will, &ldquo;both employer and
      employed!&mdash;and gentlemen&mdash;whom I am delighted to see here
      to-day! I am grateful for the opportunity so graciously extended to me&rdquo;&mdash;he
      bowed six feet of black broadcloth toward Mrs. Dankshire&mdash;&ldquo;by your
      honored President.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am grateful for the opportunity previously enjoyed, of listening to
      the most rational, practical, wise, true and hopeful words I have ever
      heard on this subject. I trust there will be enough open-minded women&mdash;and
      men&mdash;in Orchardina to make possible among us that higher business
      development of a great art which has been so convincingly laid before us.
      This club is deserving of all thanks from the community for extending to
      so many the privilege of listening to our valued fellow-citizen&mdash;Miss
      Bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He bowed again&mdash;to Miss Bell&mdash;and to Mrs. Dankshire, and resumed
      his seat, Miss Eagerson taking advantage of the dazed pause to occupy the
      platform herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Eltwood is right!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Miss Bell is right! This is the true
      presentation of the subject, 'by one who knows.' Miss Bell has pricked our
      pretty bubble so thoroughly that we don't know where we're standing&mdash;but
      she knows! Housework is a business&mdash;like any other business&mdash;I've
      always said so, and it's got to be done in a business way. Now I for one&mdash;&rdquo;
       but Miss Eagerson was rapped down by the Presidential gavel; as Mrs.
      Thaddler, portentous and severe, stalked forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not my habit to make public speeches,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;nor my desire;
      but this is a time when prompt and decisive action needs to be taken. This
      Club cannot afford to countenance any such farrago of mischievous nonsense
      as we have heard to-day. I move you, Madam President, that a resolution of
      condemnation be passed at once; and the meeting then dismissed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stalked back again, while Mrs. Marrow of Boston, in clear, cold tones
      seconded the motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But another voice was heard&mdash;for the first time in that assembly&mdash;Mrs.
      Weatherstone, the pretty, delicate widower daughter-in-law of Madam
      Weatherstone, was on her feet with &ldquo;Madam President! I wish to speak to
      this motion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you come to the platform, Mrs. Weatherstone?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Dankshire
      graciously, and the little lady came, visibly trembling, but holding her
      head high.
    </p>
    <p>
      All sat silent, all expected&mdash;what was not forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to protest, as a member of the Club, and as a woman, against the
      gross discourtesy which has been offered to the guest and speaker of the
      day. In answer to our invitation Miss Bell has given us a scholarly and
      interesting paper, and I move that we extend her a vote of thanks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I second the motion,&rdquo; came from all quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is another motion before the house,&rdquo; from others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cries of &ldquo;Madam President&rdquo; arose everywhere, many speakers were on their
      feet. Mrs. Dankshire tapped frantically with the little gavel, but Miss
      Eagerson, by sheer vocal power, took and held the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move that we take a vote on this question,&rdquo; she cried in piercing
      tones. &ldquo;Let every woman who knows enough to appreciate Miss Bell's paper&mdash;and
      has any sense of decency&mdash;stand up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quite a large proportion of the audience stood up&mdash;very informally.
      Those who did not, did not mean to acknowledge lack of intelligence and
      sense of decency, but to express emphatic disapproval of Miss Eagerson,
      Miss Bell and their views.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move you, Madam President,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Thaddler, at the top of her
      voice, &ldquo;that every member who is guilty of such grossly unparlimentary
      conduct be hereby dropped from this Club!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We hereby resign!&rdquo; cried Miss Eagerson. &ldquo;<i>We</i> drop <i>you!</i> We'll
      have a New Woman's Club in Orchardina with some warmth in its heart and
      some brains in its head&mdash;even if it hasn't as much money in its
      pocket!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amid stern rappings, hissings, cries of &ldquo;Order&mdash;order,&rdquo; and frantic
      &ldquo;Motions to adjourn&rdquo; the meeting broke up; the club elements dissolving
      and reforming into two bodies as by some swift chemical reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great was the rejoicing of the daily press; some amusement was felt,
      though courteously suppressed by the men present, and by many not present,
      when they heard of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ladies were so shocked and grieved as to withdraw from club-life
      altogether. Others, in stern dignity, upheld the shaken standards of Home
      and Culture; while the most conspicuous outcome of it all was the
      immediate formation of the New Woman's Club of Orchardina.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Behind the straight purple backs and smooth purple legs on the box before
      them, Madam Weatherstone and Mrs. Weatherstone rolled home silently, a
      silence of thunderous portent. Another purple person opened the door for
      them, and when Madam Weatherstone said, &ldquo;We will have tea on the terrace,&rdquo;
       it was brought them by a fourth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was astonished at your attitude, Viva,&rdquo; began the old lady, at length.
      &ldquo;Of course it was Mrs. Dankshire's fault in the first place, but to
      encourage that,&mdash;outrageous person! How could you do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Mrs. Weatherstone emptied her exquisite cup and set it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sudden access of courage, I suppose,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was astonished at
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wholly disagree with you!&rdquo; replied her mother-in-law. &ldquo;Never in my life
      have I heard such nonsense. Talk like that would be dangerous, if it were
      not absurd! It would destroy the home! It would strike at the roots of the
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viva eyed her quietly, trying to bear in mind the weight of a tradition,
      the habits of a lifetime, the effect of long years of uninterrupted
      worship of household gods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't seem so to me,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;I was much interested and
      impressed. She is evidently a young woman of knowledge and experience, and
      put her case well. It has quite waked me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has quite upset you!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;You'll be ill after this, I am
      sure. Hadn't you better go and lie down now? I'll have some dinner sent to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Viva, rising and walking to the edge of the broad
      terrace. &ldquo;You are very kind. No. I do not wish to lie down. I haven't felt
      so thoroughly awake in&mdash;&rdquo; she drew a pink cluster of oleander against
      her cheek and thought a moment&mdash;&ldquo;in several years.&rdquo; There was a new
      look about her certainly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nervous excitement,&rdquo; her mother-in-law replied. &ldquo;You're not like yourself
      at all to-night. You'll certainly be ill to-morrow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viva turned at this and again astonished the old lady by serenely kissing
      her. &ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; she said gaily. &ldquo;I'm going to be well to-morrow. You
      will see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to her room, drew a chair to the wide west window with the far
      off view and sat herself down to think. Diantha's assured poise, her clear
      reasoning, her courage, her common sense; and something of tenderness and
      consecration she discerned also, had touched deep chords in this woman's
      nature. It was like the sound of far doors opening, windows thrown up, the
      jingle of bridles and clatter of hoofs, keen bugle notes. A sense of hope,
      of power, of new enthusiasm, rose in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orchardina Society, eagerly observing &ldquo;young Mrs. Weatherstone&rdquo; from her
      first appearance, had always classified her as &ldquo;delicate.&rdquo; Beside the firm
      features and high color of the matron-in-office, this pale quiet slender
      woman looked like a meek and transient visitor. But her white forehead was
      broad under its soft-hanging eaves of hair, and her chin, though lacking
      in prognathous prominence or bull-dog breadth, had a certain depth which
      gave hope to the physiognomist.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was strangely roused and stirred by the afternoon's events. &ldquo;I'm like
      that man in 'Phantastes',&rdquo; she thought contemptuously, &ldquo;who stayed so long
      in that dungeon because it didn't occur to him to open the door! Why don't
      I&mdash;?&rdquo; she rose and walked slowly up and down, her hands behind her.
      &ldquo;I will!&rdquo; she said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she dressed for dinner, revolving in her mind certain suspicions long
      suppressed, but now flaming out in clear conviction in the light of
      Diantha's words. &ldquo;Sleeping in, indeed!&rdquo; she murmured to herself. &ldquo;And
      nobody doing anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked herself in the eye in the long mirror. Her gown was an
      impressive one, her hair coiled high, a gold band ringed it like a crown.
      A clear red lit her checks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang. Little Ilda, the newest maid, appeared, gazing at her in shy
      admiration. Mrs. Weatherstone looked at her with new eyes. &ldquo;Have you been
      here long?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, ma'am,&rdquo; said the child&mdash;she was scarce more. &ldquo;Only a week and
      two days. My name is Ilda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who engaged you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Halsey, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weatherstone, musing to herself, &ldquo;and I engaged Mrs.
      Halsey!&rdquo; &ldquo;Do you like it here?&rdquo; she continued kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, ma'am!&rdquo; said Ilda. &ldquo;That is&mdash;&rdquo; she stopped, blushed, and
      continued bravely. &ldquo;I like to work for you, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Ilda. Will you ask Mrs. Halsey to come to me&mdash;at once,
      please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ilda went, more impressed than ever with the desirability of her new
      place, and mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was about to pass the door of Mr. Matthew Weatherstone, that young
      gentleman stepped out and intercepted her. &ldquo;Whither away so fast, my
      dear?&rdquo; he amiably inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please let one pass, sir! I'm on an errand. Please, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must give me a kiss first!&rdquo; said he&mdash;and since there seemed no
      escape and she was in haste, she submitted. He took six&mdash;and she ran
      away half crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Halsey, little accustomed to take orders from her real mistress, and
      resting comfortably in her room, had half a mind to send an excuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not dressed,&rdquo; she said to the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well she is!&rdquo; replied Ilda, &ldquo;dressed splendid. She said 'at once,
      please.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pretty time o' day!&rdquo; said the housekeeper with some asperity, hastily
      buttoning her gown; and she presently appeared, somewhat heated, before
      Mrs. Weatherstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      That lady was sitting, cool and gracious, her long ivory paper-cutter
      between the pages of a new magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In how short a time could you pack, Mrs. Halsey?&rdquo; she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pack, ma'am? I'm not accustomed to doing packing. I'll send one of the
      maids. Is it your things, ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weatherstone. &ldquo;It is yours I refer to. I wish you to pack
      your things and leave the house&mdash;in an hour. One of the maids can
      help you, if necessary. Anything you cannot take can be sent after you.
      Here is a check for the following month's wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Halsey was nearly a head taller than her employer, a stout showy
      woman, handsome enough, red-lipped, and with a moist and crafty eye. This
      was so sudden a misadventure that she forgot her usual caution. &ldquo;You've no
      right to turn me off in a minute like this!&rdquo; she burst forth. &ldquo;I'll leave
      it to Madam Weatherstone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will look at the terms on which I engaged you, Mrs. Halsey, you
      will find that a month's warning, or a month's wages, was specified. Here
      are the wages&mdash;as to the warning, that has been given for some months
      past!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom, Ma'am?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By yourself, Mrs. Halsey&mdash;I think you understand me. Oscar will take
      your things as soon as they are ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Halsey met her steady eye a moment&mdash;saw more than she cared to
      face&mdash;and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took care, however, to carry some letters to Madam Weatherstone, and
      meekly announced her discharge; also, by some coincidence, she met Mr.
      Matthew in the hall upstairs, and weepingly confided her grievance to him,
      meeting immediate consolation, both sentimental and practical.
    </p>
    <p>
      When hurried servants were sent to find their young mistress they reported
      that she must have gone out, and in truth she had; out on her own roof,
      where she sat quite still, though shivering a little now and then from the
      new excitement, until dinner time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This meal, in the mind of Madam Weatherstone, was the crowning factor of
      daily life; and, on state occasions, of social life. In her cosmogony the
      central sun was a round mahogany table; all other details of housekeeping
      revolved about it in varying orbits. To serve an endless series of
      dignified delicious meals, notably dinners, was, in her eyes, the chief
      end of woman; the most high purpose of the home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, though angry and astounded, she appeared promptly when the meal
      was announced; and when her daughter-in-law, serene and royally attired,
      took her place as usual, no emotion was allowed to appear before the
      purple footman who attended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understood you were out, Viva,&rdquo; she said politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; replied Viva, with equal decorum. &ldquo;It is charming outside at this
      time in the evening&mdash;don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Matthew was gloomy and irritable throughout the length and breadth
      of the meal; and when they were left with their coffee in the drawing
      room, he broke out, &ldquo;What's this I hear about Mrs. Halsey being fired
      without notice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I wish to know, Viva,&rdquo; said the grandmother. &ldquo;The poor woman
      is greatly distressed. Is there not some mistake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a damn shame,&rdquo; said Matthew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger lady glanced from one to the other, and wondered to see how
      little she minded it. &ldquo;The door was there all the time!&rdquo; she thought to
      herself, as she looked her stepson in the eye and said, &ldquo;Hardly drawing-room
      language, Matthew. Your grandmother is present!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her in dumb amazement, so she went on, &ldquo;No, there is no
      mistake at all. I discharged Mrs. Halsey about an hour before dinner. The
      terms of the engagement were a month's warning or a month's wages. I gave
      her the wages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But! but!&rdquo; Madam Weatherstone was genuinely confused by this sudden
      inexplicable, yet perfectly polite piece of what she still felt to be in
      the nature of 'interference' and 'presumption.' &ldquo;I have had no fault to
      find with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have, you see,&rdquo; said her daughter-in-law smiling. &ldquo;I found her
      unsatisfactory and shall replace her with something better presently. How
      about a little music, Matthew? Won't you start the victrolla?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matthew wouldn't. He was going out; went out with the word. Madam
      Weatherstone didn't wish to hear it&mdash;had a headache&mdash;must go to
      her room&mdash;went to her room forthwith. There was a tension in the
      atmosphere that would have wrung tears from Viva Weatherstone a week ago,
      yes, twenty-four hours ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was she rose to her feet, stretching herself to her full height, and
      walked the length of the great empty room. She even laughed a little.
      &ldquo;It's open!&rdquo; said she, and ordered the car. While waiting for it she
      chatted with Mrs. Porne awhile over the all-convenient telephone.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Diantha sat at her window, watching the big soft, brilliant moon behind
      the eucalyptus trees. After the close of the strenuous meeting, she had
      withdrawn from the crowd of excited women anxious to shake her hand and
      engage her on the spot, had asked time to consider a number of good
      opportunities offered, and had survived the cold and angry glances of the
      now smaller but far more united Home and Culture Club. She declined to
      talk to the reporters, and took refuge first in an open car. This proved
      very unsatisfactory, owing to her sudden prominence. Two persistent
      newspaper men swung themselves upon the car also and insisted on
      addressing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, gentlemen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am not acquainted with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They eagerly produced their cards&mdash;and said they were &ldquo;newspaper
      men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Diantha, &ldquo;But you are still men? And gentlemen, I suppose? I
      am a woman, and I do not wish to talk with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Bell Declines to Be Interviewed,&rdquo; wrote the reporters, and spent
      themselves on her personal appearance, being favorably impressed thereby.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Miss Bell got off at the next corner and took a short cut to the house
      where she had rented a room. Reporters were waiting there, two being
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha politely but firmly declined to see them and started for the
      stairs; but they merely stood in front of her and asked questions. The
      girl's blood surged to her cheeks; she smiled grimly, kept absolute
      silence, brushed through them and went swiftly to her room, locking the
      door after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reporters described her appearance&mdash;unfavorably this time; and
      they described the house&mdash;also unfavorably. They said that &ldquo;A group
      of adoring-eyed young men stood about the doorway as the flushed heroine
      of the afternoon made her brusque entrance.&rdquo; These adorers consisted of
      the landlady's Johnny, aged thirteen, and two satellites of his, still
      younger. They <i>did</i> look at Diantha admiringly; and she <i>was</i> a
      little hurried in her entrance&mdash;truth must be maintained.

    <p>
      Too irritated and tired to go out for dinner, she ate an orange or two,
      lay down awhile, and then eased her mind by writing a long letter to Ross
      and telling him all about it. That is, she told him most of it, all the
      pleasant things, all the funny things; leaving out about the reporters,
      because she was too angry to be just, she told herself. She wrote and
      wrote, becoming peaceful as the quiet moments passed, and a sense grew
      upon her of the strong, lasting love that was waiting so patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; her swift pen flew along, &ldquo;I really feel much encouraged. An
      impression has been made. One or two men spoke to me afterward; the young
      minister, who said such nice things; and one older man, who looked
      prosperous and reliable. 'When you begin any such business as you have
      outlined, you may count on me, Miss Bell,' he said, and gave me his card.
      He's a lawyer&mdash;P. L. Wiscomb; nice man, I should think. Another big,
      sheepish-looking man said, 'And me, Miss Bell.' His name is Thaddler; his
      wife is very disagreeable. Some of the women are favorably impressed, but
      the old-fashioned kind&mdash;my! 'If hate killed men, Brother Lawrence!'&mdash;but
      it don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She wrote herself into a good humor, and dwelt at considerable length on
      the pleasant episode of the minister and young Mrs. Weatherstone's
      remarks. &ldquo;I liked her,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;She's a nice woman&mdash;even if she
      is rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock at her door. &ldquo;Lady to see you, Miss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see anyone,&rdquo; said Diantha; &ldquo;you must excuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon, Miss, but it's not a reporter; it's&mdash;.&rdquo; The landlady
      stretched her lean neck around the door edge and whispered hoarsely, &ldquo;It's
      young Mrs. Weatherstone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha rose to her feet, a little bewildered. &ldquo;I'll be right down,&rdquo; she
      said. But a voice broke in from the hall, &ldquo;I beg your pardon, Miss Bell,
      but I took the liberty of coming up; may I come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came in, and the landlady perforce went out. Mrs. Weatherstone held
      Diantha's hand warmly, and looked into her eyes. &ldquo;I was a schoolmate of
      Ellen Porne,&rdquo; she told the girl. &ldquo;We are dear friends still; and so I feel
      that I know you better than you think. You have done beautiful work for
      Mrs. Porne; now I want you to do to it for me. I need you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo; said Diantha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, too,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weatherstone. &ldquo;Now I want you to come to me&mdash;right
      away. You have done me so much good already. I was just a New England bred
      school teacher myself at first, so we're even that far. Then you took a
      step up&mdash;and I took a step down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha was a little slow in understanding the quick fervor of this new
      friend; a trifle suspicious, even; being a cautious soul, and somewhat
      overstrung, perhaps. Her visitor, bright-eyed and eager, went on. &ldquo;I gave
      up school teaching and married a fortune. You have given it up to do a
      more needed work. I think you are wonderful. Now, I know this seems queer
      to you, but I want to tell you about it. I feel sure you'll understand. At
      home, Madam Weatherstone has had everything in charge for years and years,
      and I've been too lazy or too weak, or too indifferent, to do anything. I
      didn't care, somehow. All the machinery of living, and no <i>living</i>&mdash;no
      good of it all! Yet there didn't seem to be anything else to do. Now you
      have waked me all up&mdash;your paper this afternoon&mdash;what Mr.
      Eltwood said&mdash;the way those poor, dull, blind women took it. And yet
      I was just as dull and blind myself! Well, I begin to see things now. I
      can't tell you all at once what a difference it has made; but I have a
      very definite proposition to make to you. Will you come and be my
      housekeeper, now&mdash;right away&mdash;at a hundred dollars a month?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha opened her eyes wide and looked at the eager lady as if she
      suspected her nervous balance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The other one got a thousand a year&mdash;you are worth more. Now, don't
      decline, please. Let me tell you about it. I can see that you have plans
      ahead, for this business; but it can't hurt you much to put them off six
      months, say. Meantime, you could be practicing. Our place at Santa Ulrica
      is almost as big as this one; there are lots of servants and a great,
      weary maze of accounts to be kept, and it wouldn't be bad practice for you&mdash;now,
      would it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha's troubled eyes lit up. &ldquo;No&mdash;you are right there,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;If I could do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to do just that sort of thing when you are running your
      business, won't you?&rdquo; her visitor went on. &ldquo;And the summer's not a good
      time to start a thing like that, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha meditated. &ldquo;No, I wasn't going to. I was going to start somewhere&mdash;take
      a cottage, a dozen girls or so&mdash;and furnish labor by the day to the
      other cottages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you might be able to run that on the side,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weatherstone.
      &ldquo;And you could train my girls, get in new ones if you like; it doesn't
      seem to me it would conflict. But to speak to you quite frankly, Miss
      Bell, I want you in the house for my own sake. You do me good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They discussed the matter for some time, Diantha objecting mainly to the
      suddenness of it all. &ldquo;I'm a slow thinker,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and this is so&mdash;so
      attractive that I'm suspicious of it. I had the other thing all planned&mdash;the
      girls practically engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you thinking of going?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Weatherstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Santa Ulrica.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly! Well, you shall have your cottage and our girls and give them
      part time. Or&mdash;how many have you arranged with?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only six have made definite engagements yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two laundresses, a cook and three second maids; all good ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent! Now, I tell you what to do. I will engage all those girls. I'm
      making a change at the house, for various reasons. You bring them to me as
      soon as you like; but you I want at once. I wish you'd come home with me
      to-night! Why don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha's scanty baggage was all in sight. She looked around for an
      excuse. Mrs. Weatherstone stood up laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put the new address in the letter,&rdquo; she said, mischievously, &ldquo;and come
      along!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      And the purple chauffeur, his disapproving back ineffectual in the
      darkness, rolled them home.

      CHAPTER IX. &ldquo;SLEEPING IN.&rdquo;
     </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Men have marched in armies, fleets have borne them,
      Left their homes new countries to subdue;
     Young men seeking fortune wide have wandered&mdash;
      We have something new.

     Armies of young maidens cross our oceans;
      Leave their mother's love, their father's care;
     Maidens, young and helpless, widely wander,
      Burdens new to bear.

     Strange the land and language, laws and customs;
      Ignorant and all alone they come;
     Maidens young and helpless, serving strangers,
      Thus we keep the Home.

     When on earth was safety for young maidens
      Far from mother's love and father's care?
     We preserve The Home, and call it sacred&mdash;
      Burdens new they bear.
</pre>
    <p>
      The sun had gone down on Madam Weatherstone's wrath, and risen to find it
      unabated. With condensed disapprobation written on every well-cut feature,
      she came to the coldly gleaming breakfast table.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Mrs. Halsey was undoubtedly gone, she had to admit; yet so far failed
      to find the exact words of reproof for a woman of independent means
      discharging her own housekeeper when it pleased her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mathew unexpectedly appeared at breakfast, perhaps in anticipation
      of a sort of Roman holiday in which his usually late and apologetic
      stepmother would furnish the amusement. They were both surprised to find
      her there before them, looking uncommonly fresh in crisp, sheer white,
      with deep-toned violets in her belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ate with every appearance of enjoyment, chatting amiably about the
      lovely morning&mdash;the flowers, the garden and the gardeners; her
      efforts ill seconded, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I attend to the orders this morning?&rdquo; asked Madam Weatherstone with
      an air of noble patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O no, thank you!&rdquo; replied Viva. &ldquo;I have engaged a new housekeeper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A new housekeeper! When?&rdquo; The old lady was shaken by this inconceivable
      promptness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night,&rdquo; said her daughter-in-law, looking calmly across the table,
      her color rising a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when is she coming, if I may ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has come. I have been with her an hour already this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Mathew smiled. This was amusing, though not what he had expected.
      &ldquo;How extremely alert and businesslike!&rdquo; he said lazily. &ldquo;It's becoming to
      you&mdash;to get up early!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't have got much of a person&mdash;at a minute's notice,&rdquo; said his
      grandmother. &ldquo;Or perhaps you have been planning this for some time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Viva. &ldquo;I have wanted to get rid of Mrs. Halsey for some time,
      but the new one I found yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's her name?&rdquo; inquired Mathew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bell&mdash;Miss Diantha Bell,&rdquo; she answered, looking as calm as if
      announcing the day of the week, but inwardly dreading the result somewhat.
      Like most of such terrors it was overestimated.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little pause&mdash;rather an intense little pause; and then&mdash;&ldquo;Isn't
      that the girl who set 'em all by the ears yesterday?&rdquo; asked the young man,
      pointing to the morning paper. &ldquo;They say she's a good-looker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madam Weatherstone rose from the table in some agitation. &ldquo;I must say I am
      very sorry, Viva, that you should have been so&mdash;precipitate! This
      young woman cannot be competent to manage a house like this&mdash;to say
      nothing of her scandalous ideas. Mrs. Halsey was&mdash;to my mind&mdash;perfectly
      satisfactory. I shall miss her very much.&rdquo; She swept out with an
      unanswerable air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So shall I,&rdquo; muttered Mat, under his breath, as he strolled after her;
      &ldquo;unless the new one's equally amiable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viva Weatherstone watched them go, and stood awhile looking after the
      well-built, well-dressed, well-mannered but far from well-behaved young
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't <i>know</i>,&rdquo; she said to herself, &ldquo;but I do feel&mdash;think&mdash;imagine&mdash;a
      good deal. I'm sure I hope not! Anyway&mdash;it's new life to have that
      girl in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That girl had undertaken what she described to Ross as &ldquo;a large order&mdash;a
      very large order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the hardest thing I ever undertook,&rdquo; she wrote him, &ldquo;but I think I
      can do it; and it will be a tremendous help. Mrs. Weatherstone's a brick&mdash;a
      perfect brick! She seems to have been very unhappy&mdash;for ever so long&mdash;and
      to have submitted to her domineering old mother-in-law just because she
      didn't care enough to resist. Now she's got waked up all of a sudden&mdash;she
      says it was my paper at the club&mdash;more likely my awful example, I
      think! and she fired her old housekeeper&mdash;I don't know what for&mdash;and
      rushed me in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So here I am. The salary is good, the work is excellent training, and I
      guess I can hold the place. But the old lady is a terror, and the young
      man&mdash;how you would despise that Johnny!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The home letters she now received were rather amusing. Ross, sternly
      patient, saw little difference in her position. &ldquo;I hope you will enjoy
      your new work,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;but personally I should prefer that you did not&mdash;so
      you might give it up and come home sooner. I miss you as you can well
      imagine. Even when you were here life was hard enough&mdash;but now!!!!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a half offer for the store the other day, but it fell through. If I
      could sell that incubus and put the money into a ranch&mdash;fruit, hens,
      anything&mdash;then we could all live on it; more cheaply, I think; and I
      could find time for some research work I have in mind. You remember that
      guinea-pig experiment I want so to try?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha remembered and smiled sadly. She was not much interested in
      guinea-pigs and their potential capacities, but she was interested in her
      lover and his happiness. &ldquo;Ranch,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully; &ldquo;that's not a bad
      idea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother wrote the same patient loving letters, perfunctorily hopeful.
      Her father wrote none&mdash;&ldquo;A woman's business&mdash;this
      letter-writin',&rdquo; he always held; and George, after one scornful
      upbraiding, had &ldquo;washed his hands of her&rdquo; with some sense of relief. He
      didn't like to write letters either.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Susie kept up a lively correspondence. She was attached to her sister,
      as to all her immediate relatives and surroundings; and while she utterly
      disapproved of Diantha's undertaking, a sense of sisterly duty, to say
      nothing of affection, prompted her to many letters. It did not, however,
      always make these agreeable reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother's pretty well, and the girl she's got now does nicely&mdash;that
      first one turned out to be a failure. Father's as cranky as ever. We are
      all well here and the baby (this was a brand new baby Diantha had not
      seen) is just a Darling! You ought to be here, you unnatural Aunt! Gerald
      doesn't ever speak of you&mdash;but I do just the same. You hear from the
      Wardens, of course. Mrs. Warden's got neuralgia or something; keeps them
      all busy. They are much excited over this new place of yours&mdash;you
      ought to hear them go on! It appears that Madam Weatherstone is a
      connection of theirs&mdash;one of the F. F. V's, I guess, and they think
      she's something wonderful. And to have <i>you</i> working <i>there!</i>&mdash;well,
      you can just see how they'd feel; and I don't blame them. It's no use
      arguing with you&mdash;but I should think you'd have enough of this
      disgraceful foolishness by this time and come home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha tried to be very philosophic over her home letters; but they were
      far from stimulating. &ldquo;It's no use arguing with poor Susie!&rdquo; she decided.
      &ldquo;Susie thinks the sun rises and sets between kitchen, nursery and parlor!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother can't see the good of it yet, but she will later&mdash;Mother's
      all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm awfully sorry the Wardens feel so&mdash;and make Ross unhappy&mdash;but
      of course I knew they would. It can't be helped. It's just a question of
      time and work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she went to work.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne called on her friend most promptly, with a natural eagerness
      and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does it work? Do you like her as much as you thought? Do tell me
      about it, Viva. You look like another woman already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly feel like one,&rdquo; Viva answered. &ldquo;I've seen slaves in
      housework, and I've seen what we fondly call 'Queens' in housework; but I
      never saw brains in it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne sighed. &ldquo;Isn't it just wonderful&mdash;the way she does things!
      Dear me! We do miss her! She trained that Swede for us&mdash;and she does
      pretty well&mdash;but not like 'Miss Bell'! I wish there were a hundred of
      her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If there were a hundred thousand she wouldn't go round!&rdquo; answered Mrs.
      Weatherstone. &ldquo;How selfish we are! <i>That</i> is the kind of woman we all
      want in our homes&mdash;and fuss because we can't have them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Edgar says he quite agrees with her views,&rdquo; Mrs. Porne went on. &ldquo;Skilled
      labor by the day&mdash;food sent in&mdash;. He says if she cooked it he
      wouldn't care if it came all the way from Alaska! She certainly can cook!
      I wish she'd set up her business&mdash;the sooner the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weatherstone nodded her head firmly. &ldquo;She will. She's planning. This
      was really an interruption&mdash;her coming here, but I think it will be a
      help&mdash;she's not had experience in large management before, but she
      takes hold splendidly. She's found a dozen 'leaks' in our household
      already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Thaddler's simply furious, I hear,&rdquo; said the visitor. &ldquo;Mrs. Ree was
      in this morning and told me all about it. Poor Mrs. Ree! The home is
      church and state to her; that paper of Miss Bell's she regards as simple
      blasphemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They both laughed as that stormy meeting rose before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so proud of you, Viva, standing up for her as you did. How did you
      ever dare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I got my courage from the girl herself. She was&mdash;superb! Talk of
      blasphemy! Why I've committed <i>lese majeste</i> and regicide and the
      Unpardonable Sin since that meeting!&rdquo; And she told her friend of her brief
      passage at arms with Mrs. Halsey. &ldquo;I never liked the woman,&rdquo; she
      continued; &ldquo;and some of the things Miss Bell said set me thinking. I don't
      believe we half know what's going on in our houses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Thaddler's so outraged by 'this scandalous attack upon the
      sanctities of the home' that she's going about saying all sorts of things
      about Miss Bell. O look&mdash;I do believe that's her car!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as they spoke a toneless voice announced, &ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Thaddler,&rdquo;
       and Madam Weatherstone presently appeared to greet these visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are trying a dangerous experiment!&rdquo; said Mrs. Thaddler to her
      young hostess. &ldquo;A very dangerous experiment! Bringing that young
      iconoclast into your home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thaddler, stout and sulky, sat as far away as he could and talked to
      Mrs. Porne. &ldquo;I'd like to try that same experiment myself,&rdquo; said he to her.
      &ldquo;You tried it some time, I understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed we did&mdash;and would still if we had the chance,&rdquo; she replied.
      &ldquo;We think her a very exceptional young woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thaddler chuckled. &ldquo;She is that!&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;Gad! How she did set
      things humming! They're humming yet&mdash;at our house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He glanced rather rancorously at his wife, and Mrs. Porne wished, as she
      often had before, that Mr. Thaddler wore more clothing over his domestic
      afflictions.

    <p>
      &ldquo;Scandalous!&rdquo; Mrs. Thaddler was saying to Madam Weatherstone. &ldquo;Simply
      scandalous! Never in my life did I hear such absurd&mdash;such outrageous&mdash;charges
      against the sanctities of the home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you have it!&rdquo; said Mr. Thaddler, under his breath. &ldquo;Sanctity of the
      fiddlesticks! There was a lot of truth in what that girl said!&rdquo; Then he
      looked rather sheepish and flushed a little&mdash;which was needless;
      easing his collar with a fat finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madam Weatherstone and Mrs. Thaddler were at one on this subject; but
      found it hard to agree even so, no love being lost between them; and the
      former gave evidence of more satisfaction than distress at this &ldquo;dangerous
      experiment&rdquo; in the house of her friends. Viva sat silent, but with a look
      of watchful intelligence that delighted Mrs. Porne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has done her good already,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;Bless that girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thaddler went home disappointed in the real object of his call&mdash;he
      had hoped to see the Dangerous Experiment again. But his wife was well
      pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will rue it!&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;Madam Weatherstone is ashamed of her
      daughter-in-law&mdash;I can see that! <i>She</i> looks cool enough. I
      don't know what's got into her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of that young woman's good cooking,&rdquo; her husband suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That young woman is not there as cook!&rdquo; she replied tartly. &ldquo;What she <i>is</i>
      there for we shall see later! Mark my words!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thaddler chuckled softly. &ldquo;I'll mark 'em!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha had her hands full. Needless to say her sudden entrance was
      resented by the corps of servants accustomed to the old regime. She had
      the keys; she explored, studied, inventoried, examined the accounts,
      worked out careful tables and estimates. &ldquo;I wish Mother were here!&rdquo; she
      said to herself. &ldquo;She's a regular genius for accounts. I <i>can</i> do it&mdash;but
      it's no joke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She brought the results to her employer at the end of the week. &ldquo;This is
      tentative,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I've allowed margins because I'm new to a
      business of this size. But here's what this house ought to cost you&mdash;at
      the outside, and here's what it does cost you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weatherstone was impressed. &ldquo;Aren't you a little&mdash;spectacular?&rdquo;
       she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha went over it carefully; the number of rooms, the number of
      servants, the hours of labor, the amount of food and other supplies
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is only preparatory, of course,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'll have to check it
      off each month. If I may do the ordering and keep all the accounts I can
      show you exactly in a month, or two at most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the servants?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Weatherstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was much to say here, questions of competence, of impertinence, of
      personal excellence with &ldquo;incompatibility of temper.&rdquo; Diantha was given a
      free hand, with full liberty to experiment, and met the opportunity with
      her usual energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon discharged the unsatisfactory ones, and substituted the girls she
      had selected for her summer's experiment, gradually adding others, till
      the household was fairly harmonious, and far more efficient and
      economical. A few changes were made among the men also.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the family moved down to Santa Ulrica, there was quite a new
      spirit in the household. Mrs. Weatherstone fully approved of the Girls'
      Club Diantha had started at Mrs. Porne's; and it went on merrily in the
      larger quarters of the great &ldquo;cottage&rdquo; on the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very glad I came to you, Mrs. Weatherstone,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;You were
      quite right about the experience; I did need it&mdash;and I'm getting it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was getting some of which she made no mention.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she won and held the confidence of her subordinates, and the growing
      list of club members, she learned their personal stories; what had
      befallen them in other families, and what they liked and disliked in their
      present places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men are not so bad,&rdquo; explained Catharine Kelly, at a club meeting,
      meaning the men servants; &ldquo;they respect an honest girl if she respects
      herself; but it's the young masters&mdash;and sometimes the old ones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all nonsense,&rdquo; protested Mrs. James, widowed cook of long standing.
      &ldquo;I've worked out for twenty-five years, and I never met no such goings
      on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Little Ilda looked at Mrs. James' severe face and giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard of it,&rdquo; said Molly Connors, &ldquo;I've a cousin that's workin' in
      New York; and she's had to leave two good places on account of their
      misbehavin' theirselves. She's a fine girl, but too good-lookin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha studied types, questioned them, drew them out, adjusted facts to
      theories and theories to facts. She found the weakness of the whole
      position to lie in the utter ignorance and helplessness of the individual
      servant. &ldquo;If they were only organized,&rdquo; she thought&mdash;&ldquo;and knew their
      own power!&mdash;Well; there's plenty of time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As her acquaintance increased, and as Mrs. Weatherstone's interest in her
      plans increased also, she started the small summer experiment she had
      planned, for furnishing labor by the day. Mrs. James was an excellent
      cook, though most unpleasant to work with. She was quite able to see that
      getting up frequent lunches at three dollars, and dinners at five dollars,
      made a better income than ten dollars a week even with several days
      unoccupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      A group of younger women, under Diantha's sympathetic encouragement,
      agreed to take a small cottage together, with Mrs. James as a species of
      chaperone; and to go out in twos and threes as chambermaids and waitresses
      at 25 cents an hour. Two of them could set in perfect order one of the
      small beach cottage in an hour's time; and the occupants, already crowded
      for room, were quite willing to pay a little more in cash &ldquo;not to have a
      servant around.&rdquo; Most of them took their meals out in any case.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a modest attempt, elastic and easily alterable and based on the
      special conditions of a shore resort: Mrs. Weatherstone's known interest
      gave it social backing; and many ladies who heartily disapproved of
      Diantha's theories found themselves quite willing to profit by this very
      practical local solution of the &ldquo;servant question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;club girls&rdquo; became very popular. Across the deep hot sand they
      ploughed, and clattered along the warping boardwalks, in merry pairs and
      groups, finding the work far more varied and amusing than the endless
      repetition in one household. They had pleasant evenings too, with plenty
      of callers, albeit somewhat checked and chilled by rigorous Mrs. James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is both foolish and wicked!&rdquo; said Madam Weatherstone to her
      daughter-in-law, &ldquo;Exposing a group of silly girls to such danger and
      temptations! I understand there is singing and laughing going on at that
      house until half-past ten at night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; Viva admitted. &ldquo;Mrs. James insists that they shall all be
      in bed at eleven&mdash;which is very wise. I'm glad they have good times&mdash;there's
      safety in numbers, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be a scandal in this community before long!&rdquo; said the old lady
      solemnly. &ldquo;And it grieves me to think that this household will be
      responsible for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha heard all this from the linen room while Madam Weatherstone
      buttonholed her daughter-in-law in the hall; and in truth the old lady
      meant that she should hear what she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's right, I'm afraid!&rdquo; said Diantha to herself&mdash;&ldquo;there will be a
      scandal if I'm not mighty careful and this household will be responsible
      for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as she spoke she caught Ilda's childish giggle in the lower hall, and
      looking over the railing saw her airily dusting the big Chinese vases and
      coquetting with young Mr. Mathew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on, Diantha tried seriously to rouse her conscience and her common
      sense. &ldquo;Don't you see, child, that it can't do you anything but harm? You
      can't carry on with a man like that as you can with one of your own
      friends. He is not to be trusted. One nice girl I had here simply left the
      place&mdash;he annoyed her so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ilda was a little sulky. She had been quite a queen in the small Norwegian
      village she was born in. Young men were young men&mdash;and they might
      even&mdash;perhaps! This severe young housekeeper didn't know everything.
      Maybe she was jealous!
    </p>
    <p>
      So Ilda was rather unconvinced, though apparently submissive, and Diantha
      kept a careful eye upon her. She saw to it that Ilda's room had a bolt as
      well as key in the door, and kept the room next to it empty; frequently
      using it herself, unknown to anyone. &ldquo;I hate to turn the child off,&rdquo; she
      said to herself, conscientiously revolving the matter. &ldquo;She isn't doing a
      thing more than most girls do&mdash;she's only a little fool. And he's not
      doing anything I can complain of&mdash;yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she worried over it a good deal, and Mrs. Weatherstone noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't your pet club house go well, 'Miss Bell?' You seem troubled about
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; Diantha admitted. &ldquo;I believe I'll have to tell you about it&mdash;but
      I hate to. Perhaps if you'll come and look I shan't have to say much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led her to a window that looked on the garden, the rich, vivid,
      flower-crowded garden of Southern California by the sea. Little Ilda, in a
      fresh black frock and snowy, frilly cap and apron, ran out to get a rose;
      and while she sniffed and dallied they saw Mr. Mathew saunter out and join
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was not as severe with him as she ought to have been&mdash;that
      was evident; but it was also evident that she was frightened and furious
      when he suddenly held her fast and kissed her with much satisfaction. As
      soon as her arms were free she gave him a slap that sounded smartly even
      at that distance; and ran crying into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's foolish, I admit,&rdquo; said Diantha,&mdash;&ldquo;but she doesn't realize her
      danger at all. I've tried to make her. And now I'm more worried than ever.
      It seems rather hard to discharge her&mdash;she needs care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll speak to that young man myself,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weatherstone. &ldquo;I'll speak
      to his grandmother too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O&mdash;would you?&rdquo; urged Diantha. &ldquo;She wouldn't believe anything except
      that the girl 'led him on'&mdash;you know that. But I have an idea that we
      could convince her&mdash;if you're willing to do something rather
      melodramatic&mdash;and I think we'd better do it to-night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asked her employer; and Diantha explained. It was
      melodramatic, but promised to be extremely convincing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think he'd dare! under my roof?&rdquo; hotly demanded Madam
      Weatherstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very much afraid it wouldn't be the first time,&rdquo; Diantha reluctantly
      assured her. &ldquo;It's no use being horrified. But if we could only make <i>sure</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we could only make his grandmother sure!&rdquo; cried Madam Weatherstone.
      &ldquo;That would save me a deal of trouble and misunderstanding. See here&mdash;I
      think I can manage it&mdash;what makes you think it's to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't be absolutely certain&mdash;&rdquo; Diantha explained; and told her the
      reasons she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does look so,&rdquo; her employer admitted. &ldquo;We'll try it at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Urging her mother-in-law's presence on the ground of needing her
      experienced advice, Mrs. Weatherstone brought the august lady to the room
      next to Ilda's late that evening, the housekeeper in attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We mustn't wake the servants,&rdquo; she said in an elaborate whisper. &ldquo;They
      need sleep, poor things! But I want to consult you about these
      communicating doors and the locksmith is coming in the morning.&mdash;you
      see this opens from this side.&rdquo; She turned the oiled key softly in the
      lock. &ldquo;Now Miss Bell thinks they ought to be left so&mdash;so that the
      girls can visit one another if they like&mdash;what do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are absurd to bring me to the top floor, at this time of
      night, for a thing like this!&rdquo; said the old lady. &ldquo;They should be
      permanently locked, to my mind! There's no question about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Viva, still in low tones, discussed this point further; introduced the
      subject of wall-paper or hard finish; pointed out from the window a tall
      eucalyptus which she thought needed heading; did what she could to keep
      her mother-in-law on the spot; and presently her efforts were rewarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sound of muffled speech came from the next room&mdash;a man's voice
      dimly heard. Madam Weatherstone raised her head like a warhorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this! What's this!&rdquo; she said in a fierce whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viva laid a hand on her arm. &ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Let us make sure!&rdquo; and she
      softly unlatched the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brilliant moon flooded the small chamber. They could see little Ilda,
      huddled in the bedclothes, staring at her door from which the key had
      fallen. Another key was being inserted&mdash;turned&mdash;but the bolt
      held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and open it, young lady!&rdquo; said a careful voice outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away! Go away!&rdquo; begged the girl, low and breathlessly. &ldquo;Oh how <i>can</i>
      you! Go away quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I won't!&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;You come and open it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away,&rdquo; she cried, in a soft but frantic voice. &ldquo;I&mdash;I'll scream!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scream away!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I'll just say I came up to see what the
      screaming's about, that's all. You open the door&mdash;if you don't want
      anybody to know I'm here! I won't hurt you any&mdash;I just want to talk
      to you a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madam Weatherstone was speechless with horror, her daughter-in-law
      listened with set lips. Diantha looked from one to the other, and at the
      frightened child before them who was now close to the terrible door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O please!&mdash;<i>please!</i> go away!&rdquo; she cried in desperation. &ldquo;O
      what shall I do! What shall I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't do anything,&rdquo; he answered cheerfully. &ldquo;And I'm coming in
      anyhow. You'd better keep still about this for your own sake. Stand from
      under!&rdquo; Madam Weatherstone marched into the room. Ilda, with a little cry,
      fled out of it to Diantha.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a jump, a scramble, two knuckly hands appeared, a long leg was
      put through the transom, two legs wildly wriggling, a descending body, and
      there stood before them, flushed, dishevelled, his coat up to his ears&mdash;Mat
      Weatherstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not notice the stern rigidity of the figure which stood between him
      and the moonlight, but clasped it warmly to his heart.&mdash;&ldquo;Now I've got
      you, Ducky!&rdquo; cried he, pressing all too affectionate kisses upon the face
      of his grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mrs. Weatherstone turned on the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an embarrassing position for the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had expected to find a helpless cowering girl; afraid to cry out
      because her case would be lost if she did; begging piteously that he would
      leave her; wholly at his mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he did find was so inexplicable as to reduce him to gibbering
      astonishment. There stood his imposing grandmother, so overwhelmed with
      amazement that her trenchant sentences failed her completely; his
      stepmother, wearing an expression that almost suggested delight in his
      discomfiture; and Diantha, as grim as Rhadamanthus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor little Ilda burst into wild sobs and choking explanations, clinging
      to Diantha's hand. &ldquo;If I'd only listened to you!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You told me
      he was bad! I never thought he'd do such an awful thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Young Mathew fumbled at the door. He had locked it outside in his efforts
      with the pass-key. He was red, red to his ears&mdash;very red, but there
      was no escape. He faced them&mdash;there was no good in facing the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all stood aside and let him pass&mdash;a wordless gauntlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha took the weeping Ilda to her room for the night. Madam
      Weatherstone and Mrs. Weatherstone went down together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She must have encouraged him!&rdquo; the older lady finally burst forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not encourage him to enter her room, as you saw and heard,&rdquo; said
      Viva with repressed intensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's only a boy!&rdquo; said his grandmother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is only a child, a helpless child, a foreigner, away from home,
      untaught, unprotected,&rdquo; Viva answered swiftly; adding with quiet sarcasm&mdash;&ldquo;Save
      for the shelter of the home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They parted in silence.

     &ldquo;We are weak!&rdquo; said the Sticks, and men broke them;

    <p>
      Ross Warden endured his grocery business; strove with it, toiled at it,
      concentrated his scientific mind on alien tasks of financial calculation
      and practical psychology, but he liked it no better. He had no interest in
      business, no desire to make money, no skill in salesmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were five mouths at home; sweet affectionate feminine mouths no
      doubt, but requiring food. Also two in the kitchen, wider, and requiring
      more food. And there were five backs at home to be covered, to use the
      absurd metaphor&mdash;as if all one needed for clothing was a four foot
      patch. The amount and quality of the covering was an unceasing surprise to
      Ross, and he did not do justice to the fact that his womenfolk really
      saved a good deal by doing their own sewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his heart he longed always to be free of the whole hated load of
      tradesmanship. Continually his thoughts went back to the hope of selling
      out the business and buying a ranch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could make it keep us, anyhow,&rdquo; he would plan to himself; &ldquo;and I could
      get at that guinea pig idea. Or maybe hens would do.&rdquo; He had a theory of
      his own, or a personal test of his own, rather, which he wished to apply
      to a well known theory. It would take some years to work it out, and a
      great many fine pigs, and be of no possible value financially. &ldquo;I'll do it
      sometime,&rdquo; he always concluded; which was cold comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      His real grief at losing the companionship of the girl he loved, was made
      more bitter by a total lack of sympathy with her aims, even if she
      achieved them&mdash;in which he had no confidence. He had no power to
      change his course, and tried not to be unpleasant about it, but he had to
      express his feelings now and then.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming back to me?&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;How con you bear to give so much
      pain to everyone who loves you? Is your wonderful salary worth more to you
      than being here with your mother&mdash;with me? How can you say you love
      me&mdash;and ruin both our lives like this? I cannot come to see you&mdash;I
      <i>would</i> not come to see you&mdash;calling at the back door! Finding
      the girl I love in a cap and apron! Can you not see it is wrong, utterly
      wrong, all this mad escapade of yours? Suppose you do make a thousand
      dollars a year&mdash;I shall never touch your money&mdash;you know that. I
      cannot even offer you a home, except with my family, and I know how you
      feel about that; I do not blame you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am as stubborn as you are, dear girl; I will not live on my wife's
      money&mdash;you will not live in my mother's house&mdash;and we are
      drifting apart. It is not that I care less for you dear, or at all for
      anyone else, but this is slow death&mdash;that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Warden wrote now and then and expatiated on the sufferings of her
      son, and his failing strength under the unnatural strain, till Diantha
      grew to dread her letters more than any pain she knew. Fortunately they
      came seldom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her own family was much impressed by the thousand dollars, and found the
      occupation of housekeeper a long way more tolerable than that of
      house-maid, a distinction which made Diantha smile rather bitterly. Even
      her father wrote to her once, suggesting that if she chose to invest her
      salary according to his advice he could double it for her in a year, maybe
      treble it, in Belgian hares.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;They'd</i> double and treble fast enough!&rdquo; she admitted to herself;
      but she wrote as pleasant a letter as she could, declining his
      proposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother seemed stronger, and became more sympathetic as the months
      passed. Large affairs always appealed to her more than small ones, and she
      offered valuable suggestions as to the account keeping of the big house.
      They all assumed that she was permanently settled in this well paid
      position, and she made no confidences. But all summer long she planned and
      read and studied out her progressive schemes, and strengthened her hold
      among the working women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laundress after laundress she studied personally and tested
      professionally, finding a general level of mediocrity, till finally she
      hit upon a melancholy Dane&mdash;a big rawboned red-faced woman&mdash;whose
      husband had been a miller, but was hurt about the head so that he was no
      longer able to earn his living. The huge fellow was docile, quiet, and
      endlessly strong, but needed constant supervision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll do anything you tell him, Miss, and do it well; but then he'll sit
      and dream about it&mdash;I can't leave him at all. But he'll take the
      clothes if I give him a paper with directions, and come right back.&rdquo; Poor
      Mrs. Thorald wiped her eyes, and went on with her swift ironing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha offered her the position of laundress at Union House, with two
      rooms for their own, over the laundry. &ldquo;There'll be work for him, too,&rdquo;
       she said. &ldquo;We need a man there. He can do a deal of the heavier work&mdash;be
      porter you know. I can't offer him very much, but it will help some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thorald accepted for both, and considered Diantha as a special
      providence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was to be cook, and two capable second maids. The work of the house
      must be done thoroughly well, Diantha determined; &ldquo;and the food's got to
      be good&mdash;or the girls wont stay.&rdquo; After much consideration she
      selected one Julianna, a &ldquo;person of color,&rdquo; for her kitchen: not the
      jovial and sloppy personage usually figuring in this character, but a
      tall, angular, and somewhat cynical woman, a misanthrope in fact, with a
      small son. For men she had no respect whatever, but conceded a grudging
      admiration to Mr. Thorald as &ldquo;the usefullest biddablest male person&rdquo; she
      had ever seen. She also extended special sympathy to Mrs. Thorald on
      account of her peculiar burden, and the Swedish woman had no antipathy to
      her color, and seemed to take a melancholy pleasure in Julianna's caustic
      speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha offered her the place, boy and all. &ldquo;He can be 'bell boy' and help
      you in the kitchen, too. Can't you, Hector?&rdquo; Hector rolled large adoring
      eyes at her, but said nothing. His mother accepted the proposition, but
      without enthusiasm. &ldquo;I can't keep no eye on him, Miss, if I'm cookin' an
      less'n you keep your eye on him they's no work to be got out'n any kind o'
      boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your last name, Julianna?&rdquo; Diantha asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, as a matter o' fac' its de name of de last nigger I married,&rdquo;
       she replied. &ldquo;Dere was several of 'em, all havin' different names, and to
      tell you de truf Mis' Bell, I got clean mixed amongst 'em. But Julianna's
      my name&mdash;world without end amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Diantha had to waive her theories about the surnames of servants in
      this case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they all die?&rdquo; she asked with polite sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'm, dey didn't none of 'em die&mdash;worse luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you have seen much trouble, Julianna,&rdquo; she continued
      sympathetically; &ldquo;They deserted you, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julianna laid her long spoon upon the table and stood up with great
      gravity. &ldquo;No'm,&rdquo; she said again, &ldquo;dey didn't none of 'em desert me on no
      occasion. I divorced 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Marital difficulties in bulk were beyond Diantha's comprehension, and she
      dropped the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Union House opened in the autumn. The vanished pepper trees were dim with
      dust in Orchardina streets as the long rainless summer drew to a close;
      but the social atmosphere fairly sparkled with new interest. Those who had
      not been away chattered eagerly with those who had, and both with the
      incoming tide of winter visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl of Mrs. Porne's has started her housekeeping shop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That 'Miss Bell' has got Mrs. Weatherstone fairly infatuated with her
      crazy schemes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know that Bell girl has actually taken Union House? Going to make
      a Girl's Club of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever <i>hear</i> of such a thing! Diantha Bell's really going to
      try to run her absurd undertaking right here in Orchardina!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They did not know that the young captain of industry had deliberately
      chosen Orchardina as her starting point on account of the special
      conditions. The even climate was favorable to &ldquo;going out by the day,&rdquo; or
      the delivery of meals, the number of wealthy residents gave opportunity
      for catering on a large scale; the crowding tourists and health seekers
      made a market for all manner of transient service and cooked food, and the
      constant lack of sufficient or capable servants forced the people into an
      unwilling consideration of any plan of domestic assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a year's deliberate effort Diantha had acquainted herself with the rank
      and file of the town's housemaids and day workers, and picked her
      assistants carefully. She had studied the local conditions thoroughly, and
      knew her ground. A big faded building that used to be &ldquo;the Hotel&rdquo; in
      Orchardina's infant days, standing, awkward and dingy on a site too
      valuable for a house lot and not yet saleable as a business block, was the
      working base.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half year with Mrs. Weatherstone gave her $500 in cash, besides the $100
      she had saved at Mrs. Porne's; and Mrs. Weatherstone's cheerfully offered
      backing gave her credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate to let you,&rdquo; said Diantha, &ldquo;I want to do it all myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a painfully perfect person, Miss Bell,&rdquo; said her last employer,
      pleasantly, &ldquo;but you have ceased to be my housekeeper and I hope you will
      continue to be my friend. As a friend I claim the privilege of being
      disagreeable. If you have a fault it is conceit. Immovable Colossal
      Conceit! And Obstinacy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Diantha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all I've found&mdash;so far,&rdquo; gaily retorted Mrs. Weatherstone.
      &ldquo;Don't you see, child, that you can't afford to wait? You have reasons for
      hastening, you know. I don't doubt you could, in a series of years, work
      up this business all stark alone. I have every confidence in those
      qualities I have mentioned! But what's the use? You'll need credit for
      groceries and furniture. I am profoundly interested in this business. I am
      more than willing to advance a little capital, or to ensure your credit. A
      man would have sense enough to take me up at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you are right,&rdquo; Diantha reluctantly agreed. &ldquo;And you shan't
      lose by it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her friends were acutely interested in her progress, and showed it in
      practical ways. The New Woman's Club furnished five families of patrons
      for the regular service of cooked food, which soon grew, with
      satisfaction, to a dozen or so, varying from time to time. The many
      families with invalids, and lonely invalids without families, were glad to
      avail themselves of the special delicacies furnished at Union House.
      Picnickers found it easier to buy Diantha's marvelous sandwiches than to
      spend golden morning hours in putting up inferior ones at home; and many
      who cooked for themselves, or kept servants, were glad to profit by this
      outside source on Sunday evenings and &ldquo;days out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was opposition too; both the natural resistance of inertia and
      prejudice, and the active malignity of Mrs. Thaddler.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pornes were sympathetic and anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That place'll cost her all of $10,000 a year, with those twenty-five to
      feed, and they only pay $4.50 a week&mdash;I know that!&rdquo; said Mr. Porne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does look impossible,&rdquo; his wife agreed, &ldquo;but such is my faith in
      Diantha Bell I'd back her against Rockefeller!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weatherstone was not alarmed at all. &ldquo;If she <i>should</i> fail&mdash;which
      I don't for a moment expect&mdash;it wont ruin me,&rdquo; she told Isabel. &ldquo;And
      if she succeeds, as I firmly believe she will, why, I'd be willing to risk
      almost anything to prove Mrs. Thaddler in the wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thaddler was making herself rather disagreeable. She used what power
      she had to cry down the undertaking, and was so actively malevolent that
      her husband was moved to covert opposition. He never argued with his wife&mdash;she
      was easily ahead of him in that art, and, if it came to recriminations,
      had certain controvertible charges to make against him, which mode him
      angrily silent. He was convinced in a dim way that her ruthless
      domineering spirit, and the sheer malice she often showed, were more evil
      things than his own bad habits; and that even in their domestic relation
      her behavior really caused him more pain and discomfort than he caused
      her; but he could not convince her of it, naturally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That Diantha Bell is a fine girl,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;A damn fine girl,
      and as straight as a string!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There had crept out, through the quenchless leak of servants talk, a
      varicolored version of the incident of Mathew and the transom; and the
      town had grown so warm for that young gentleman that he had gone to Alaska
      suddenly, to cool off, as it were. His Grandmother, finding Mrs. Thaddler
      invincible with this new weapon, and what she had so long regarded as her
      home now visibly Mrs. Weatherstone's, had retired in regal dignity to her
      old Philadelphia establishment, where she upheld the standard of decorum
      against the weakening habits of a deteriorated world, for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Thaddler thought of this sweeping victory, he chuckled for the
      hundredth time. &ldquo;She ought to make good, and she will. Something's got to
      be done about it,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha had never liked Mr. Thaddler; she did not like that kind of man in
      general, nor his manner toward her in particular. Moreover he was the
      husband of Mrs. Thaddler. She did not know that he was still the largest
      owner in the town's best grocery store, and when that store offered her
      special terms for her exclusive trade, she accepted the proposition
      thankfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told Ross about it, as a matter well within his knowledge, if not his
      liking, and he was mildly interested. &ldquo;I am much alarmed at this new
      venture,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;but you must get your experience. I wish I could save
      you. As to the groceries, those are wholesale rates, nearly; they'll make
      enough on it. Yours is a large order you see, and steady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she opened her &ldquo;Business Men's Lunch&rdquo; Mr. Thaddler had a still better
      opportunity. He had a reputation as a high flyer, and had really intended
      to sacrifice himself on the altar of friendship by patronizing and
      praising this &ldquo;undertaking&rdquo; at any cost to his palate; but no sacrifice
      was needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha's group of day workers had their early breakfast and departed,
      taking each her neat lunch-pail,&mdash;they ate nothing of their
      employers;&mdash;and both kitchen and dining room would have stood idle
      till supper time. But the young manager knew she must work her plant for
      all it was worth, and speedily opened the dining room with the side
      entrance as a &ldquo;Caffeteria,&rdquo; with the larger one as a sort of meeting
      place; papers and magazines on the tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the counter you took what you liked, and seated yourself, and your
      friends, at one of the many small tables or in the flat-armed chairs in
      the big room, or on the broad piazza; and as this gave good food,
      cheapness, a chance for a comfortable seat and talk and a smoke, if one
      had time, it was largely patronized.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thaddler, as an experienced <i>bon vivant,</i> despised sandwiches.
      &ldquo;Picnicky makeshifts&rdquo; he called them,&mdash;&ldquo;railroad rations&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;bread
      and leavings,&rdquo; and when he saw these piles on piles of sandwiches, listed
      only as &ldquo;No. 1,&rdquo; &ldquo;No. 2&rdquo; &ldquo;No. 3,&rdquo; and so on, his benevolent intention
      wavered. But he pulled himself together and took a plateful, assorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, Porne,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we'll play it's a Sunday school picnic,&rdquo; and
      he drew himself a cup of coffee, finding hot milk, cream and sugar
      crystals at hand. &ldquo;I never saw a cheap joint where you could fix it
      yourself, before,&rdquo; he said,&mdash;and suspiciously tasted the mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By jing! That's coffee!&rdquo; he cried in surprise. &ldquo;There's no scum on the
      milk, and the cream's cream! Five cents! She won't get rich on this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he applied himself to his &ldquo;No. 1&rdquo; sandwich, and his determined
      expression gave way to one of pleasure. &ldquo;Why that's bread&mdash;real
      bread! I believe she made it herself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did in truth,&mdash;she and Julianna with Hector as general assistant.
      The big oven was filled several times every morning: the fresh rolls
      disappeared at breakfast and supper, the fresh bread was packed in the
      lunch pails, and the stale bread was even now melting away in large bites
      behind the smiling mouths and mustaches of many men. Perfect bread,
      excellent butter, and &ldquo;What's the filling I'd like to know?&rdquo; More than one
      inquiring-minded patron split his sandwich to add sight to taste, but few
      could be sure of the flavorsome contents, fatless, gritless, smooth and
      even, covering the entire surface, the last mouthful as perfect as the
      first. Some were familiar, some new, all were delicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The six sandwiches were five cents, the cup of coffee five, and the little
      &ldquo;drop cakes,&rdquo; sweet and spicy, were two for five. Every man spent fifteen
      cents, some of them more; and many took away small cakes in paper bags, if
      there were any left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how you can do it, and make a profit,&rdquo; urged Mr. Eltwood,
      making a pastorial call. &ldquo;They are so good you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha smiled cheerfully. &ldquo;That's because all your ideas are based on
      what we call 'domestic economy,' which is domestic waste. I buy in large
      quantities at wholesale rates, and my cook with her little helper, the two
      maids, and my own share of the work, of course, provides for the lot. Of
      course one has to know how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whenever did you find&mdash;or did you create?&mdash;those heavenly
      sandwiches?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to thank my laundress for part of that success,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She's
      a Dane, and it appears that the Danes are so fond of sandwiches that, in
      large establishments, they have a 'sandwich kitchen' to prepare them. It
      is quite a bit of work, but they are good and inexpensive. There is no
      limit to the variety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact this lunch business paid well, and led to larger
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's methods were simple and so organized as to make one hand wash
      the other. Her house had some twenty-odd bedrooms, full accommodations for
      kitchen and laundry work on a large scale, big dining, dancing, and
      reception rooms, and broad shady piazzas on the sides. Its position on a
      corner near the business part of the little city, and at the foot of the
      hill crowned with so many millionaires and near millionaires as could get
      land there, offered many advantages, and every one was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main part of the undertaking was a House Worker's Union; a group of
      thirty girls, picked and trained. These, previously working out as
      servants, had received six dollars a week &ldquo;and found.&rdquo; They now worked an
      agreed number of hours, were paid on a basis by the hour or day, and
      &ldquo;found&rdquo; themselves. Each had her own room, and the broad porches and ball
      room were theirs, except when engaged for dances and meetings of one sort
      and another.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a stirring year's work, hard but exciting, and the only difficulty
      which really worried Diantha was the same that worried the average
      housewife&mdash;the accounts.

      CHAPTER XI. THE POWER OF THE SCREW.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Your car is too big for one person to stir&mdash;
      Your chauffeur is a little man, too;
     Yet he lifts that machine, does the little chauffeur,
      By the power of a gentle jackscrew.
</pre>
    <p>
      Diantha worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      For all her employees she demanded a ten-hour day, she worked fourteen;
      rising at six and not getting to bed till eleven, when her charges were
      all safely in their rooms for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all up at five-thirty or thereabouts, breakfasting at six, and
      the girls off in time to reach their various places by seven. Their day
      was from 7 A. M. to 8.30 P. M., with half an hour out, from 11.30 to
      twelve, for their lunch; and three hours, between 2.20 and 5.30, for their
      own time, including their tea. Then they worked again from 5.30 to 8.30,
      on the dinner and the dishes, and then they came home to a pleasant nine
      o'clock supper, and had all hour to dance or rest before the 10.30 bell
      for bed time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Special friends and &ldquo;cousins&rdquo; often came home with them, and frequently
      shared the supper&mdash;for a quarter&mdash;and the dance for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no light matter in the first place to keep twenty girls contented
      with such a regime, and working with the steady excellence required, and
      in the second place to keep twenty employers contented with them. There
      were failures on both sides; half a dozen families gave up the plan, and
      it took time to replace them; and three girls had to be asked to resign
      before the year was over. But most of them had been in training in the
      summer, and had listened for months to Diantha's earnest talks to the
      clubs, with good results.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember we are not doing this for ourselves alone,&rdquo; she would say to
      them. &ldquo;Our experiment is going to make this kind of work easier for all
      home workers everywhere. You may not like it at first, but neither did you
      like the old way. It will grow easier as we get used to it; and we <i>must</i>
      keep the rules, because we made them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laboriously composed a neat little circular, distributed it widely,
      and kept a pile in her lunch room for people to take.
    </p>
    <p>
      It read thus:
    </p>

</pre>
    <p>
      What annoyed the young manager most was the uncertainty and irregularity
      involved in her work, the facts varying considerably from her
      calculations.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the house all ran smoothly. Solemn Mrs. Thorvald did the laundry work
      for thirty-five&mdash;by the aid of her husband and a big mangle for the
      &ldquo;flat work.&rdquo; The girls' washing was limited. &ldquo;You have to be reasonable
      about it,&rdquo; Diantha had explained to them. &ldquo;Your fifty cents covers a dozen
      pieces&mdash;no more. If you want more you have to pay more, just as your
      employers do for your extra time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last often happened. No one on the face of it could ask more than ten
      hours of the swift, steady work given by the girls at but a fraction over
      14 cents an hour. Yet many times the housekeeper was anxious for more
      labor on special days; and the girls, unaccustomed to the three free hours
      in the afternoon, were quite willing to furnish it, thus adding somewhat
      to their cash returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a dressmaking class at the club afternoons, and as Union House
      boasted a good sewing machine, many of them spent the free hours in
      enlarging their wardrobes. Some amused themselves with light reading, a
      few studied, others met and walked outside. The sense of honest leisure
      grew upon them, with its broadening influence; and among her thirty
      Diantha found four or five who were able and ambitious, and willing to
      work heartily for the further development of the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her two housemaids were specially selected. When the girls were out of the
      house these two maids washed the breakfast dishes with marvelous speed,
      and then helped Diantha prepare for the lunch. This was a large
      undertaking, and all three of them, as well as Julianna and Hector worked
      at it until some six or eight hundred sandwiches were ready, and two or
      three hundred little cakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha had her own lunch, and then sat at the receipt of custom during
      the lunch hour, making change and ordering fresh supplies as fast as
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two housemaids had a long day, but so arranged that it made but ten
      hours work, and they had much available time of their own. They had to be
      at work at 5:30 to set the table for six o'clock breakfast, and then they
      were at it steadily, with the dining rooms to &ldquo;do,&rdquo; and the lunch to get
      ready, until 11:30, when they had an hour to eat and rest. From 12:30 to 4
      o'clock they were busy with the lunch cups, the bed-rooms, and setting the
      table for dinner; but after that they had four hours to themselves, until
      the nine o'clock supper was over, and once more they washed dishes for
      half an hour. The caffeteria used only cups and spoons; the sandwiches and
      cakes were served on paper plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hand-cart methods of small housekeeping it is impossible to exact
      the swift precision of such work, but not in the standardized tasks and
      regular hours of such an establishment as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha religiously kept her hour at noon, and tried to keep the three in
      the afternoon; but the employer and manager cannot take irresponsible rest
      as can the employee. She felt like a most inexperienced captain on a
      totally new species of ship, and her paper plans looked very weak
      sometimes, as bills turned out to be larger than she had allowed for, or
      her patronage unaccountably dwindled. But if the difficulties were great,
      the girl's courage was greater. &ldquo;It is simply a big piece of work,&rdquo; she
      assured herself, &ldquo;and may be a long one, but there never was anything
      better worth doing. Every new business has difficulties, I mustn't think
      of them. I must just push and push and push&mdash;a little more every
      day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then she would draw on all her powers to reason with, laugh at, and
      persuade some dissatisfied girl; or, hardest of all, to bring in a new one
      to fill a vacancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She enjoyed the details of her lunch business, and studied it carefully;
      planning for a restaurant a little later. Her bread was baked in long
      cylindrical closed pans, and cut by machinery into thin even slices, not a
      crust wasted; for they were ground into crumbs and used in the cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The filling for her sandwiches was made from fish, flesh, and fowl; from
      cheese and jelly and fruit and vegetables; and so named or numbered that
      the general favorites were gradually determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Thaddler chatted with her over the counter, as far as she would allow
      it, and discoursed more fully with his friends on the verandah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Porne,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where'd that girl come from anyway? She's a genius,
      that's what she is; a regular genius.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's all that,&rdquo; said Mr. Porne, &ldquo;and a benefactor to humanity thrown in.
      I wish she'd start her food delivery, though. I'm tired of those two
      Swedes already. O&mdash;come from? Up in Jopalez, Inca County, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;New England stock I bet,&rdquo; said Mr. Thaddler. &ldquo;Its a damn shame the way
      the women go on about her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not all of them, surely,&rdquo; protested Mr. Porne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not all of 'em,&mdash;but enough of 'em to make mischief, you may be
      sure. Women are the devil, sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Porne smiled without answer, and Mr. Thaddler went sulking away&mdash;a
      bag of cakes bulging in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little wooden hotel in Jopalez boasted an extra visitor a few days
      later. A big red faced man, who strolled about among the tradesmen, tried
      the barber's shop, loafed in the post office, hired a rig and traversed
      the length and breadth of the town, and who called on Mrs. Warden, talking
      real estate with her most politely in spite of her protestation and the
      scornful looks of the four daughters; who bought tobacco and matches in
      the grocery store, and sat on the piazza thereof to smoke, as did other
      gentlemen of leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross Warden occasionally leaned at the door jamb, with folded arms. He
      never could learn to be easily sociable with ranchmen and teamsters. Serve
      them he must, but chat with them he need not. The stout gentleman essayed
      some conversation, but did not get far. Ross was polite, but far from
      encouraging, and presently went home to supper, leaving a carrot-haired
      boy to wait upon his lingering customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice young feller enough,&rdquo; said the stout gentleman to himself, &ldquo;but
      raised on ramrods. Never got 'em from those women folks of his, either. He
      <i>has</i> a row to hoe!&rdquo; And he departed as he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Eltwood turned out an unexpectedly useful friend to Diantha. He
      steered club meetings and &ldquo;sociables&rdquo; into her large rooms, and as people
      found how cheap and easy it was to give parties that way, they continued
      the habit. He brought his doctor friends to sample the lunch, and they
      tested the value of Diantha's invalid cookery, and were more than pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hungry tourists were wholly without prejudice, and prized her lunches for
      their own sake. They descended upon the caffeteria in chattering swarms,
      some days, robbing the regular patrons of their food, and sent sudden
      orders for picnic lunches that broke in upon the routine hours of the
      place unmercifully.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of all her patrons, the families of invalids appreciated Diantha's
      work the most. Where a little shack or tent was all they could afford to
      live in, or where the tiny cottage was more than filled with the patient,
      attending relative, and nurse, this depot of supplies was a relief indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A girl could be had for an hour or two; or two girls, together, with
      amazing speed, could put a small house in dainty order while the sick man
      lay in his hammock under the pepper trees; and be gone before he was
      fretting for his bed again. They lived upon her lunches; and from them,
      and other quarters, rose an increasing demand for regular cooked food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don't you go into it at once?&rdquo; urged Mrs. Weatherstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to establish the day service first,&rdquo; said Diantha. &ldquo;It is a pretty
      big business I find, and I do get tired sometimes. I can't afford to slip
      up, you know. I mean to take it up next fall, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. And look here; see that you begin in first rate shape. I've
      got some ideas of my own about those food containers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They discussed the matter more than once, Diantha most reluctant to take
      any assistance; Mrs. Weatherstone determined that she should.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like a big investor already,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don't think even you
      realize the <i>money</i> there is in this thing! You are interested in
      establishing the working girls, and saving money and time for the
      housewives. I am interested in making money out of it&mdash;honestly! It
      would be such a triumph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're very good&mdash;&rdquo; Diantha hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not good. I'm most eagerly and selfishly interested. I've taken a new
      lease of life since knowing you, Diantha Bell! You see my father was a
      business man, and his father before him&mdash;I <i>like it.</i> There I
      was, with lots of money, and not an interest in life! Now?&mdash;why,
      there's no end to this thing, Diantha! It's one of the biggest businesses
      on earth&mdash;if not <i>the</i> biggest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I know,&rdquo; the girl answered. &ldquo;But its slow work. I feel the
      weight of it more than I expected. There's every reason to succeed, but
      there's the combined sentiment of the whole world to lift&mdash;it's as
      heavy as lead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavy! Of course it's heavy! The more fun to lift it! You'll do it,
      Diantha, I know you will, with that steady, relentless push of yours. But
      the cooked food is going to be your biggest power, and you must let me
      start it right. Now you listen to me, and make Mrs. Thaddler eat her
      words!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thaddler's words would have proved rather poisonous, if eaten. She
      grew more antagonistic as the year advanced. Every fault that could be
      found in the undertaking she pounced upon and enlarged; every doubt that
      could be cast upon it she heavily piled up; and her opposition grew more
      rancorous as Mr. Thaddler enlarged in her hearing upon the excellence of
      Diantha's lunches and the wonders of her management.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's picked a bunch o' winners in those girls of hers,&rdquo; he declared to
      his friends. &ldquo;They set out in the morning looking like a flock of sweet
      peas&mdash;in their pinks and whites and greens and vi'lets,&mdash;and do
      more work in an hour than the average slavey can do in three, I'm told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a pretty sight to see those girls start out. They had a sort of
      uniform, as far as a neat gingham dress went, with elbow sleeves, white
      ruffled, and a Dutch collar; a sort of cross between a nurses dress and
      that of &ldquo;La Chocolataire;&rdquo; but colors were left to taste. Each carried her
      apron and a cap that covered the hair while cooking and sweeping; but
      nothing that suggested the black and white livery of the regulation
      servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a new stage of labor,&rdquo; their leader reminded them. &ldquo;You are not
      servants&mdash;you are employees. You wear a cap as an English carpenter
      does&mdash;or a French cook,&mdash;and an apron because your work needs
      it. It is not a ruffled label,&mdash;it's a business necessity. And each
      one of us must do our best to make this new kind of work valued and
      respected.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is no easy matter to overcome prejudices many centuries old, and meet
      the criticism of women who have nothing to do but criticize. Those who
      were &ldquo;mistresses,&rdquo; and wanted &ldquo;servants,&rdquo;&mdash;someone to do their will
      at any moment from early morning till late evening,&mdash;were not pleased
      with the new way if they tried it; but the women who had interests of
      their own to attend to; who merely wanted their homes kept clean, and the
      food well cooked and served, were pleased. The speed, the accuracy, the
      economy; the pleasant, quiet, assured manner of these skilled employees
      was a very different thing from the old slipshod methods of the ordinary
      general servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the work slowly prospered, while Diantha began to put in execution the
      new plan she had been forced into.
    </p>
    <p>
      While it matured, Mrs. Thaddler matured hers. With steady dropping she had
      let fall far and wide her suspicions as to the character of Union House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks pretty queer to me!&rdquo; she would say, confidentially, &ldquo;All those
      girls together, and no person to have any authority over them! Not a
      married woman in the house but that washerwoman,&mdash;and her husband's a
      fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And again; You don't see how she does it? Neither do I! The expenses must
      be tremendous&mdash;those girls pay next to nothing,&mdash;and all that
      broth and brown bread flying about town! Pretty queer doings, I think!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men seem to like that caffeteria, don't they?&rdquo; urged one caller,
      perhaps not unwilling to nestle Mrs. Thaddler, who flushed darkly as she
      replied. &ldquo;Yes, they do. Men usually like that sort of place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They like good food at low prices, if that's what you mean,&rdquo; her visitor
      answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's not all I mean&mdash;by a long way,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thaddler. She said
      so much, and said it so ingeniously, that a dark rumor arose from nowhere,
      and grew rapidly. Several families discharged their Union House girls.
      Several girls complained that they were insultingly spoken to on the
      street. Even the lunch patronage began to fall off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha was puzzled&mdash;a little alarmed. Her slow, steady lifting of
      the prejudice against her was checked. She could not put her finger on the
      enemy, yet felt one distinctly, and had her own suspicions. But she also
      had her new move well arranged by this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a maliciously insinuating story of the place came out in a San
      Francisco paper, and a flock of local reporters buzzed in to sample the
      victim. They helped themselves to the luncheon, and liked it, but that did
      not soften their pens. They talked with such of the girls as they could
      get in touch with, and wrote such versions of these talks as suited them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They called repeatedly at Union House, but Diantha refused to see them.
      Finally she was visited by the Episcopalian clergyman. He had heard her
      talk at the Club, was favorably impressed by the girl herself, and
      honestly distressed by the dark stories he now heard about Union House.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have called to see you in your own
      interests. I do not, as you perhaps know, approve of your schemes. I
      consider them&mdash;ah&mdash;subversive of the best interests of the home!
      But I think you mean well, though mistakenly. Now I fear you are not aware
      that this-ah&mdash;ill-considered undertaking of yours, is giving rise to
      considerable adverse comment in the community. There is&mdash;ah&mdash;there
      is a great deal being said about this business of yours which I am sure
      you would regret if you knew it. Do you think it is wise; do you think it
      is&mdash;ah&mdash;right, my dear Miss Bell, to attempt to carry on a&mdash;a
      place of this sort, without the presence of a&mdash;of a Matron of assured
      standing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha smiled rather coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I trouble you to step into the back parlor, Dr. Aberthwaite,&rdquo; she
      said; and then;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I have the pleasure of presenting to you Mrs. Henderson Bell&mdash;my
      mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't it great!&rdquo; said Mrs. Weatherstone; &ldquo;I was there you see,&mdash;I'd
      come to call on Mrs. Bell&mdash;she's a dear,&mdash;and in came Mrs.
      Thaddler&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Thaddler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O I know it was old Aberthwaite, but he represented Mrs. Thaddler and her
      clique, and had come there to preach to Diantha about propriety&mdash;I
      heard him,&mdash;and she brought him in and very politely introduced him
      to her mother!&mdash;it was rich, Isabel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did Diantha manage it?&rdquo; asked her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's been trying to arrange it for ever so long. Of course her father
      objected&mdash;you'd know that. But there's a sister&mdash;not a bad sort,
      only very limited; she's taken the old man to board, as it were, and I
      guess the mother really set her foot down for once&mdash;said she had a
      right to visit her own daughter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would seem so,&rdquo; Mrs. Porne agreed. &ldquo;I <i>am</i> so glad! It will be so
      much easier for that brave little woman now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha held her mother in her arms the night she came, and cried tike a
      baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O mother <i>dear!</i>&rdquo; she sobbed, &ldquo;I'd no idea I should miss you so
      much. O you blessed comfort!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother cried a bit too; she enjoyed this daughter more than either of
      her older children, and missed her more. A mother loves all her children,
      naturally; but a mother is also a person&mdash;and may, without sin, have
      personal preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took hold of Diantha's tangled mass of papers with the eagerness of a
      questing hound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got all the bills, of course,&rdquo; she demanded, with her anxious
      rising inflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every one,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;You taught me that much. What puzzles me is
      to make things balance. I'm making more than I thought in some lines, and
      less in others, and I can't make it come out straight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't, altogether, till the end of the year I dare say,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Bell, &ldquo;but let's get clear as far as we can. In the first place we must
      separate your business,&mdash;see how much each one pays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The first one I want to establish,&rdquo; said her daughter, &ldquo;is the girl's
      club. Not just this one, with me to run it. But to show that any group of
      twenty or thirty girls could do this thing in any city. Of course where
      rents and provisions were high they'd have to charge more. I want to make
      an average showing somehow. Now can you disentangle the girl part front
      the lunch part and the food part, mother dear, and make it all straight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bell could and did; it gave her absolute delight to do it. She set
      down the total of Diantha's expenses so far in the Service Department, as
      follows:
    </p>

</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That covers everything but my board,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now your income is easy&mdash;35 x $4.50 equals $8,190. Take that from
      your $9,000 and you are $810 behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Diantha, eagerly, &ldquo;but if it was merely a girl's club
      home, the rent and fixtures would be much less. A home could be built,
      with thirty bedrooms&mdash;and all necessary conveniences&mdash;for
      $7,000. I've asked Mr. and Mrs. Porne about it; and the furnishing needn't
      cost over $2,000 if it was very plain. Ten per cent. of that is a rent of
      $900 you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;Better say a thousand. I guess it could be done
      for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they set down rent, $1,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There have to be five paid helpers in the house,&rdquo; Diantha went on, &ldquo;the
      cook, the laundress, the two maids, and the matron. She must buy and
      manage. She could be one of their mothers or aunts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bell smiled. &ldquo;Do you really imagine, Diantha, that Mrs. O'Shaughnessy
      or Mrs. Yon Yonson can manage a house like this as you can?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha flushed a little. &ldquo;No, mother, of course not. But I am keeping
      very full reports of all the work. Just the schedule of labor&mdash;the
      hours&mdash;the exact things done. One laundress, with machinery, can wash
      for thirty-five, (its only six a day you see), and the amount is
      regulated; about six dozen a day, and all the flat work mangled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a Girl's Club alone the cook has all day off, as it were; she can do
      the down stairs cleaning. And the two maids have only table service and
      bedrooms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty-five bedrooms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. But two girls together, who know how, can do a room in 8 minutes&mdash;easily.
      They are small and simple you see. Make the bed, shake the mats, wipe the
      floors and windows,&mdash;you watch them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have watched them,&rdquo; the mother admitted. &ldquo;They are as quick as&mdash;as
      mill-workers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; pursued Diantha, &ldquo;they spend three hours on dishes and tables, and
      seven on cleaning. The bedrooms take 280 minutes; that's nearly five
      hours. The other two are for the bath rooms, halls, stairs, downstairs
      windows, and so on. That's all right. Then I'm keeping the menus&mdash;just
      what I furnish and what it costs. Anybody could order and manage when it
      was all set down for her. And you see&mdash;as you have figured it&mdash;they'd
      have over $500 leeway to buy the furniture if they were allowed to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mrs. Bell admitted, &ldquo;<i>if</i> the rent was what you allow, and <i>if</i>
      they all work all the time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the hitch, of course. But mother; the girls who don't have steady
      jobs do work by the hour, and that brings in more, on the whole. If they
      are the right kind they can make good. If they find anyone who don't keep
      her job&mdash;for good reasons&mdash;they can drop her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;M'm!&rdquo; said Mrs. Bell. &ldquo;Well, it's an interesting experiment. But how
      about you? So far you are $410 behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, because my rent's so big. But I cover that by letting the rooms, you
      see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bell considered the orders of this sort. &ldquo;So far it averages about
      $25.00 a week; that's doing well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be less in summer&mdash;much less,&rdquo; Diantha suggested. &ldquo;Suppose
      you call it an average of $15.00.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it $10.00,&rdquo; said her mother ruthlessly. &ldquo;At that it covers your
      deficit and $110 over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which isn't much to live on,&rdquo; Diantha agreed, &ldquo;but then comes my special
      catering, and the lunches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here they were quite at sea for a while. But as the months passed, and the
      work steadily grew on their hands, Mrs. Bell became more and more
      cheerful. She was up with the earliest, took entire charge of the
      financial part of the concern, and at last Diantha was able to rest fully
      in her afternoon hours. What delighted her most was to see her mother
      thrive in the work. Her thin shoulders lifted a little as small dragging
      tasks were forgotten and a large growing business substituted. Her eyes
      grew bright again, she held her head as she did in her keen girlhood, and
      her daughter felt fresh hope and power as she saw already the benefit of
      the new method as affecting her nearest and dearest.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Diantha's friends watched the spread of the work with keenly
      sympathetic intent; but to Mrs. Weatherstone it became almost as
      fascinating as to the girl herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's going to be one of the finest businesses in the world!&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;And one of the largest and best paying. Now I'll have a surprise ready
      for that girl in the spring, and another next year, if I'm not mistaken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were long and vivid discussions of the matter between her and her
      friends the Pornes, and Mrs. Porne spent more hours in her &ldquo;drawing room&rdquo;
       than she had for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while these unmentioned surprises were pending, Mrs. Weatherstone
      departed to New York&mdash;to Europe; and was gone some months. In the
      spring she returned, in April&mdash;which is late June in Orchardina. She
      called upon Diantha and her mother at once, and opened her attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope, Mrs. Bell, that you'll back me up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have the
      better business head I think, in the financial line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has,&rdquo; Diantha admitted. &ldquo;She's ten times as good as I am at that; but
      she's no more willing to carry obligation than I am, Mrs. Weatherstone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obligation is one thing&mdash;investment is another,&rdquo; said her guest. &ldquo;I
      live on my money&mdash;that is, on other people's work. I am a base
      capitalist, and you seem to me good material to invest in. So&mdash;take
      it or leave it&mdash;I've brought you an offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then produced from her hand bag some papers, and, from her car
      outside, a large object carefully boxed, about the size and shape of a
      plate warmer. This being placed on the table before them, was uncovered,
      and proved to be a food container of a new model.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had one made in Paris,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;and the rest copied here to
      save paying duty. Lift it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They lifted it in amazement&mdash;it was so light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aluminum,&rdquo; she said, proudly, &ldquo;Silver plated&mdash;new process! And
      bamboo at the corners you see. All lined and interlined with asbestos,
      rubber fittings for silver ware, plate racks, food compartments&mdash;see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She pulled out drawers, opened little doors, and rapidly laid out a table
      service for five.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will hold food for five&mdash;the average family, you know. For larger
      orders you'll have to send more. I had to make <i>some</i> estimate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What lovely dishes!&rdquo; said Diantha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't they! Aluminum, silvered! If your washers are careful they won't
      get dented, and you can't break 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bell examined the case and all its fittings with eager attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the prettiest thing I ever saw,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Look, Diantha; here's
      for soup, here's for water&mdash;or wine if you want, all your knives and
      forks at the side, Japanese napkins up here. Its lovely, but&mdash;I
      should think&mdash;expensive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weatherstone smiled. &ldquo;I've had twenty-five of them made. They cost,
      with the fittings, $100 apiece, $2,500. I will rent them to you, Miss
      Bell, at a rate of 10 per cent. interest; only $250 a year!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ought to take more,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bell, &ldquo;there'll be breakage and waste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't break them, I tell you,&rdquo; said the cheerful visitor, &ldquo;and dents
      can be smoothed out in any tin shop&mdash;you'll have to pay for it;&mdash;will
      that satisfy you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha was looking at her, her eyes deep with gratitude. &ldquo;I&mdash;you
      know what I think of you!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weatherstone laughed. &ldquo;I'm not through yet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Look at my
      next piece of impudence!&rdquo; This was only on paper, but the pictures were
      amply illuminating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went to several factories,&rdquo; she gleefully explained, &ldquo;here and abroad.
      A Yankee firm built it. It's in my garage now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a light gasolene motor wagon, the body built like those
      old-fashioned moving wagons which were also used for excursions, wherein
      the floor of the vehicle was rather narrow, and set low, and the seats ran
      lengthwise, widening out over the wheels; only here the wheels were lower,
      and in the space under the seats ran a row of lockers opening outside.
      Mrs. Weatherstone smiled triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Diantha Bell,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;here's something you haven't thought of, I
      do believe! This estimable vehicle will carry thirty people inside
      easily,&rdquo; and she showed them how each side held twelve, and turn-up seats
      accommodated six more; &ldquo;and outside,&rdquo;&mdash;she showed the lengthwise
      picture&mdash;&ldquo;it carries twenty-four containers. If you want to send all
      your twenty-five at once, one can go here by the driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then. This is not an obligation, Miss Bell, it is another valuable
      investment. I'm having more made. I expect to have use for them in a good
      many places. This cost pretty near $3,000, and you get it at the same good
      interest, for $300 a year. What's more, if you are smart enough&mdash;and
      I don't doubt you are,&mdash;you can buy the whole thing on installments,
      same as you mean to with your furniture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha was dumb, but her mother wasn't. She thanked Mrs. Weatherstone
      with a hearty appreciation of her opportune help, but no less of her
      excellent investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be a goose, Diantha,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You will set up your food business
      in first class style, and I think you can carry it successfully. But Mrs.
      Weatherstone's right; she's got a new investment here that'll pay her
      better than most others&mdash;and be a growing thing I do believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And still Diantha found it difficult to express her feelings. She had
      lived under a good deal of strain for many months now, and this sudden
      opening out of her plans was a heavenly help indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weatherstone went around the table and sat by her. &ldquo;Child,&rdquo; said she,
      &ldquo;you don't begin to realize what you've done for me&mdash;and for Isobel&mdash;and
      for ever so many in this town, and all over the world. And besides, don't
      you think anybody else can see your dream? We can't <i>do</i> it as you
      can, but we can see what it's going to mean,&mdash;and we'll help if we
      can. You wouldn't grudge us that, would you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As a result of all this the cooked food delivery service was opened at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true that the tourists are gone, mostly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weatherstone,
      as she urged it, &ldquo;but you see there are ever so many residents who have
      more trouble with servants in summer than they do in winter, and hate to
      have a fire in the house, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Diantha's circulars had an addition, forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were distributed among the Orchardinians, setting their tongues
      wagging anew, as a fresh breeze stirs the eaves of the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stealthy inroads of lunches and evening refreshments had been
      deprecated already; this new kind of servant who wasn't a servant, but
      held her head up like anyone else (&ldquo;They are as independent as&mdash;as&mdash;'salesladies,'&rdquo;
       said one critic), was also viewed with alarm; but when even this domestic
      assistant was to be removed, and a square case of food and dishes
      substituted, all Archaic Orchardina was horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were plenty of new minds in the place, however; enough to start
      Diantha with seven full orders and five partial ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her work at the club was now much easier, thanks to her mother's
      assistance, to the smoother running of all the machinery with the passing
      of time, and further to the fact that most of her girls were now working
      at summer resorts, for shorter hours and higher wages. They paid for their
      rooms at the club still, but the work of the house was so much lightened
      that each of the employees was given two weeks of vacation&mdash;on full
      pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lunch department kept on a pretty regular basis from the patronage of
      resident business men, and the young manager&mdash;in her ambitious
      moments&mdash;planned for enlarging it in the winter. But during the
      summer her whole energies went to perfecting the <i>menus</i> and the
      service of her food delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne was the very first to order. She had been waiting impatiently
      for a chance to try the plan, and, with her husband, had the firmest faith
      in Diantha's capacity to carry it through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't save much in money,&rdquo; she explained to the eager Mrs. Ree, who
      hovered, fascinated, over the dangerous topic, &ldquo;but we do in comfort, I
      can tell you. You see I had two girls, paid them $12 a week; now I keep
      just the one, for $6. My food and fuel for the four of us (I don't count
      the babies either time&mdash;they remain as before), was all of $16, often
      more. That made $28 a week. Now I pay for three meals a day, delivered,
      for three of us, $15 a week&mdash;with the nurse's wages, $21. Then I pay
      a laundress one day, $2, and her two meals, $.50, making $23.50. Then I
      have two maids, for an hour a day, to clean; $.50 a day for six days, $3,
      and one maid Sunday, $.25. $26.75 in all. So we only make $1.25. <i>But!</i>
      there's another room! We have the cook's room for an extra guest; I use it
      most for a sewing room, though and the kitchen is a sort of day nursery
      now. The house seems as big again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the food?&rdquo; eagerly inquired Mrs. Ree. &ldquo;Is it as good as your own? Is
      it hot and tempting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ree was fascinated by the new heresy. As a staunch adherent of the
      old Home and Culture Club, and its older ideals, she disapproved of the
      undertaking, but her curiosity was keen about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne smiled patiently. &ldquo;You remember Diantha Bell's cooking I am
      sure, Mrs. Ree,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And Julianna used to cook for dinner parties&mdash;when
      one could get her. My Swede was a very ordinary cook, as most of these
      untrained girls are. Do take off your hat and have dinner with us,&mdash;I'll
      show you,&rdquo; urged Mrs. Porne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;O I mustn't,&rdquo; fluttered the little woman. &ldquo;They'll expect me at
      home&mdash;and&mdash;surely your&mdash;supply&mdash;doesn't allow for
      guests?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll arrange all that by 'phone,&rdquo; her hostess explained; and she
      promptly sent word to the Ree household, then called up Union House and
      ordered one extra dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it&mdash;I'm dreadfully rude I know, but I'm <i>so</i> interested! Is
      it&mdash;expensive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne smiled. &ldquo;Haven't you seen the little circular? Here's one,
      'Extra meals to regular patrons 25 cents.' And no more trouble to order
      than to tell a maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ree had a lively sense of paltering with Satan as she sat down to the
      Porne's dinner table. She had seen the delivery wagon drive to the door,
      had heard the man deposit something heavy on the back porch, and was now
      confronted by a butler's tray at Mrs. Porne's left, whereon stood a neat
      square shining object with silvery panels and bamboo trimmings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not at all bad looking, is it?&rdquo; she ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not bad enough to spoil one's appetite,&rdquo; Mr. Porne cheerily agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Open, Sesame! Now you know the worst.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne opened it, and an inner front was shown, with various small
      doors and drawers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what is in it?&rdquo; asked the guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank goodness, I don't,&rdquo; replied her hostess. &ldquo;If there's anything
      tiresome it is to order meals and always know what's coming! That's what
      men get so tired of at restaurants; what they hate so when their wives ask
      them what they want for dinner. Now I can enjoy my dinner at my own table,
      just as if I was a guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;a tax&mdash;sometimes,&rdquo; Mrs. Ree admitted, adding hastily,
      &ldquo;But one is glad to do it&mdash;to make home attractive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Porne's eyes sought his wife's, and love and contentment flashed
      between them, as she quietly set upon the table three silvery plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not silver, surely!&rdquo; said Mrs. Ree, lifting hers, &ldquo;Oh, aluminum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aluminum, silver plated,&rdquo; said Mr. Porne. &ldquo;They've learned how to do it
      at last. It's a problem of weight, you see, and breakage. Aluminum isn't
      pretty, glass and silver are heavy, but we all love silver, and there's a
      pleasant sense of gorgeousness in this outfit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did look rather impressive; silver tumblers, silver dishes, the whole
      dainty service&mdash;and so surprisingly light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see she knows that it is very important to please the eye as well as
      the palate,&rdquo; said Mr. Porne. &ldquo;Now speaking of palates, let us all keep
      silent and taste this soup.&rdquo; They did keep silent in supreme contentment
      while the soup lasted. Mrs. Ree laid down her spoon with the air of one
      roused from a lovely dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;it's like Paris,&rdquo; she said in an awed tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it?&rdquo; Mr. Porne agreed, &ldquo;and not twice alike in a month, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there aren't thirty kinds of soup, are there?&rdquo; she urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never thought there were when we kept servants,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Three was
      about their limit, and greasy, at that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne slipped the soup plates back in their place and served the
      meat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not give a fish course, does she?&rdquo; Mrs. Ree observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at the table d'hote price,&rdquo; Mrs. Porne answered. &ldquo;We never pretended
      to have a fish course ourselves&mdash;do you?&rdquo; Mrs. Ree did not, and
      eagerly disclaimed any desire for fish. The meat was roast beef, thinly
      sliced, hot and juicy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you miss the carving, Mr. Porne?&rdquo; asked the visitor. &ldquo;I do so love
      to see a man at the head of his own table, carving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do miss it, Mrs. Ree. I miss it every day of my life with devout
      thankfulness. I never was a good carver, so it was no pleasure to me to
      show off; and to tell you the truth, when I come to the table, I like to
      eat&mdash;not saw wood.&rdquo; And Mr. Porne ate with every appearance of
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We never get roast beef like this I'm sure,&rdquo; Mrs. Ree admitted, &ldquo;we can't
      get it small enough for our family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And a little roast is always spoiled in the cooking. Yes this is far
      better than we used to have,&rdquo; agreed her hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ree enjoyed every mouthful of her meal. The soup was hot. The salad
      was crisp and the ice cream hard. There was sponge cake, thick, light,
      with sugar freckles on the dark crust. The coffee was perfect and almost
      burned the tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand about the heat and cold,&rdquo; she said; and they showed
      her the asbestos-lined compartments and perfectly fitting places for each
      dish and plate. Everything went back out of sight; small leavings in a
      special drawer, knives and forks held firmly by rubber fittings, nothing
      that shook or rattled. And the case was set back by the door where the man
      called for it at eight o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't furnish table linen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there are Japanese napkins at the top here. We like our own napkins,
      and we didn't use a cloth, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how about silver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We put ours away. This plated ware they furnish is perfectly good. We
      could use ours of course if we wanted to wash it. Some do that and some
      have their own case marked, and their own silver in it, but it's a good
      deal of risk, I think, though they are extremely careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Ree experienced peculiarly mixed feelings. As far as food went, she
      had never eaten a better dinner. But her sense of Domestic Aesthetics was
      jarred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly tastes good,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Delicious, in fact. I am extremely
      obliged to you, Mrs. Porne, I'd no idea it could be sent so far and be so
      good. And only five dollars a week, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For each person, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how she does it. All those cases and dishes, and the delivery
      wagon!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the universal comment in Orchardina circles as the months passed
      and Union House continued in existence&mdash;&ldquo;I don't see how she does
      it!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XII. LIKE A BANYAN TREE
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     The Earth-Plants spring up from beneath,
      The Air-Plants swing down from above,
       But the Banyan trees grow
       Both above and below,
      And one makes a prosperous grove.
</pre>
    <p>
      In the fleeting opportunities offered by the Caffeteria, and in longer
      moments, rather neatly planned for, with some remnants of an earlier
      ingenuity, Mr. Thaddler contrived to become acquainted with Mrs. Bell.
      Diantha never quite liked him, but he won her mother's heart by frank
      praise of the girl and her ventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw a smarter woman in my life,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and no airs. I tell
      you, ma'am, if there was more like her this world would be an easier place
      to live in, and I can see she owes it all to you, ma'am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This the mother would never admit for a moment, but expatiated loyally on
      the scientific mind of Mr. Henderson Bell, still of Jopalez.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how he can bear to let her out of his sight,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Thaddler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he hated to let her go,&rdquo; replied the lady. &ldquo;We both did. But he
      is very proud of her now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess there's somebody else who's proud of her, too,&rdquo; he suggested.
      &ldquo;Excuse me, ma'am, I don't mean to intrude, but we know there must be a
      good reason for your daughter keeping all Orchardina at a distance. Why,
      she could have married six times over in her first year here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not wish to give up her work,&rdquo; Mrs. Bell explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not; and why should she? Nice, womanly business, I am sure. I
      hope nobody'd expect a girl who can keep house for a whole township to
      settle down to bossing one man and a hired girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In course of time he got a pretty clear notion of how matters stood, and
      meditated upon it, seriously rolling his big cigar about between pursed
      lips. Mr. Thaddler was a good deal of a gossip, but this he kept to
      himself, and did what he could to enlarge the patronage of Union House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business grew. It held its own in spite of fluctuations, and after a
      certain point began to spread steadily. Mrs. Bell's coming and Mr.
      Eltwood's ardent championship, together with Mr. Thaddler's, quieted the
      dangerous slanders which had imperilled the place at one time. They
      lingered, subterraneously, of course. People never forget slanders. A
      score of years after there were to be found in Orchardina folk who still
      whispered about dark allegations concerning Union House; and the papers
      had done some pretty serious damage; but the fame of good food, good
      service, cheapness and efficiency made steady headway.
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of the increase and of the plans still working in her mind,
      Diantha made certain propositions to Mr. Porne, and also to Mrs. Porne, in
      regard to a new, specially built club-house for the girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have proved what they can do, with me to manage them, and want now to
      prove that they can do it themselves, with any matron competent to follow
      my directions. The house need not be so expensive; one big dining-room,
      with turn-up tables like those ironing-board seat-tables, you know&mdash;then
      they can dance there. Small reception room and office, hall, kitchen and
      laundry, and thirty bedrooms, forty by thirty, with an &ldquo;ell&rdquo; for the
      laundry, ought to do it, oughtn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porne agreed to make plans, and did so most successfully, and Mr.
      Porne found small difficulty in persuading an investor to put up such a
      house, which visibly could be used as a boarding-house or small hotel, if
      it failed in its first purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was built of concrete, a plain simple structure, but fine in
      proportions and pleasantly colored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha kept her plans to herself, as usual, but they grew so fast that
      she felt a species of terror sometimes, lest the ice break somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, now!&rdquo; she would say. &ldquo;This is real business, just plain business.
      There's no reason why I shouldn't succeed as well as Fred Harvey. I will
      succeed. I am succeeding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She kept well, she worked hard, she was more than glad to have her mother
      with her; but she wanted something else, which seemed farther off than
      ever. Her lover's picture hung on the wall of her bedroom, stood on her
      bureau, and (but this was a secret) a small one was carried in her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather a grim looking young woman, Diantha, with the cares of the world of
      house-keepers upon her proud young shoulders; with all the stirring hopes
      to be kept within bounds, all the skulking fears to be resisted, and the
      growing burden of a large affair to be carried steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she woke, in the brilliant California mornings, she would lie
      still a few moments looking at the face on the wall and the face on the
      bureau; would draw the little picture out from under her pillow and kiss
      it, would say to herself for the thousandth time, &ldquo;It is for him, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She missed him, always.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very vigor of her general attitude, the continued strength with which
      she met the days and carried them, made it all the more needful for her to
      have some one with whom she could forget every care, every purpose, every
      effort; some one who would put strong arms around her and call her &ldquo;Little
      Girl.&rdquo; His letters were both a comfort and a pain. He was loyal, kind,
      loving, but always that wall of disapproval. He loved her, he did not love
      her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      She read them over and over, hunting anew for the tender phrases, the
      things which seemed most to feed and comfort her. She suffered not only
      from her loneliness, but from his; and most keenly from his sternly
      suppressed longing for freedom and the work that belonged to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why can't he see,&rdquo; she would say to herself, &ldquo;that if this succeeds, he
      can do his work; that I can make it possible for him? And he won't let me.
      He won't take it from me. Why are men so proud? Is there anything so
      ignominious about a woman that it is disgraceful to let one help you? And
      why can't he think at all about the others? It's not just us, it's all
      people. If this works, men will have easier times, as well as women.
      Everybody can do their real work better with this old primitive business
      once set right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then it was always time to get up, or time to go to bed, or time to
      attend to some of the numberless details of her affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and her mother had an early lunch before the caffeteria opened, and
      were glad of the afternoon tea, often held in a retired corner of the
      broad piazza. She sat there one hot, dusty afternoon, alone and unusually
      tired. The asphalted street was glaring and noisy, the cross street deep
      in soft dust, for months unwet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failure had not discouraged her, but increasing success with all its
      stimulus and satisfaction called for more and more power. Her mind was
      busy foreseeing, arranging, providing for emergencies; and then the whole
      thing slipped away from her, she dropped her head upon her arm for a
      moment, on the edge of the tea table, and wished for Ross.
    </p>
    <p>
      From down the street and up the street at this moment, two men were
      coming; both young, both tall, both good looking, both apparently
      approaching Union House. One of them was the nearer, and his foot soon
      sounded on the wooden step. The other stopped and looked in a shop window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha started up, came forward,&mdash;it was Mr. Eltwood. She had a
      vague sense of disappointment, but received him cordially. He stood there,
      his hat off, holding her hand for a long moment, and gazing at her with
      evident admiration. They turned and sat down in the shadow of the
      reed-curtained corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man at the shop window turned, too, and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Eltwood had been a warm friend and cordial supporter from the epoch of
      the Club-splitting speech. He had helped materially in the slow, up-hill
      days of the girl's effort, with faith and kind words. He had met the
      mother's coming with most friendly advances, and Mrs. Bell found herself
      much at home in his liberal little church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha had grown to like and trust him much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this about the new house, Miss Bell? Your mother says I may know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have followed this thing from the first. Sugar
      or lemon? You see I want to disentangle the undertakings, set them upon
      their own separate feet, and establish the practical working of each one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and 'day service' is not 'cooked food delivery.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor yet 'rooms for entertainment',&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;We've got them all
      labelled, mother and I. There's the 'd. s.' and 'c. f. d.' and 'r. f. e.'
      and the 'p. p.' That's picnics and parties. And more coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, more yet? You'll kill yourself, Miss Bell. Don't go too fast. You
      are doing a great work for humanity. Why not take a little more time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to do it as quickly as I can, for reasons,&rdquo; answered Diantha.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Eltwood looked at her with tender understanding. &ldquo;I don't want to
      intrude any further than you are willing to want me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
      sometimes I think that even you&mdash;strong as you are&mdash;would be
      better for some help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not contradict him. Her hands were in her lap, her eyes on the
      worn boards of the piazza floor. She did not see a man pass on the other
      side of the street, cast a searching glance across and walk quickly on
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were quite free to go on with your beautiful work,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Eltwood slowly, &ldquo;if you were offered heartiest appreciation, profound
      respect, as well as love, of course; would you object to marrying, Miss
      Bell?&rdquo; asked in an even voice, as if it were a matter of metaphysical
      inquiry. Mrs. Porne had told him of her theory as to a lover in the home
      town, wishing to save him a long heart ache, but he was not sure of it,
      and he wanted to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha glanced quickly at him, and felt the emotion under his quiet
      words. She withdrew her eyes, looking quite the other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are enough of a friend to know, Mr. Eltwood,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I rather
      thought you did know. I am engaged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for telling me; some one is greatly to be congratulated,&rdquo; he
      spoke sincerely, and talked quietly on about less personal matters,
      holding his tea untasted till it was cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do let me give you some that is hot,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;and let me thank
      you from my heart for the help and strength and comfort you have been to
      me, Mr. Eltwood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very glad,&rdquo; he said; and again, &ldquo;I am very glad.&rdquo; &ldquo;You may count upon
      anything I can do for you, always,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I am proud to be your
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held her hand once more for a moment, and went away with his head up
      and a firm step. To one who watched him go, he had almost a triumphant
      air, but it was not triumph, only the brave beginning of a hard fight and
      a long one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came Mrs. Bell, returned from a shopping trip, and sank down in a
      wicker rocker, glad of the shade and a cup of tea. No, she didn't want it
      iced. &ldquo;Hot tea makes you cooler,&rdquo; was her theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't look very tired,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Seems to me you get stronger
      all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said her mother. &ldquo;You don't realize, you can't realize, Diantha,
      what this means to me. Of course to you I am an old woman, a back number&mdash;one
      has to feel so about one's mother. I did when I married, and my mother
      then was five years younger than I am now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you old, mother, not a bit of it. You ought to have twenty
      or thirty years of life before you, real life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just what I'm feeling,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bell, &ldquo;as if I'd just begun to
      live! This is so <i>different!</i> There is a big, moving thing to work
      for. There is&mdash;why Diantha, you wouldn't believe what a comfort it is
      to me to feel that my work here is&mdash;really&mdash;adding to the
      profits!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha laughed aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear old darling,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I should think it was! It is <i>making</i>
      the profits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it grows so,&rdquo; her mother went on. &ldquo;Here's this part so well assured
      that you're setting up the new Union House! Are you <i>sure</i> about Mrs.
      Jessup, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as I can be of any one till I've tried a long time. She has done
      all I've asked her to here, and done it well. Besides, I mean to keep a
      hand on it for a year or two yet&mdash;I can't afford to have that fail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jessup was an imported aunt, belonging to one of the cleverest girls,
      and Diantha had had her in training for some weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess she's as good as any you'd be likely to get,&rdquo; Mrs. Bell
      admitted, &ldquo;and we mustn't expect paragons. If this can't be done by an
      average bunch of working women the world over, it can't be done&mdash;that's
      all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can be done,&rdquo; said the girl, calmly. &ldquo;It will be done. You see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Thaddler says you could run any kind of a business you set your hand
      to,&rdquo; her mother went on. &ldquo;He has a profound respect for your abilities,
      Dina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems to me you and Mr. Thaddler have a good deal to say to each other,
      motherkins. I believe you enjoy that caffeteria desk, and all the
      compliments you get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bell stoutly. &ldquo;I do indeed! Why, I haven't seen so many
      men, to speak to, since&mdash;why, never in my life! And they are very
      amusing&mdash;some of them. They like to come here&mdash;like it
      immensely. And I don't wonder. I believe you'll do well to enlarge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they plunged into a discussion of the winter's plans. The day service
      department and its employment agency was to go on at the New Union House,
      with Mrs. Jessup as manager; the present establishment was to be run as a
      hotel and restaurant, and the depot for the cooked food delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Thorvald and her husband were installed by themselves in another new
      venture; a small laundry outside the town. This place employed several
      girls steadily, and the motor wagon found a new use between meals, in
      collecting and delivering laundry parcels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It simplifies it a lot&mdash;to get the washing out of the place and the
      girls off my mind,&rdquo; said Diantha. &ldquo;Now I mean to buckle down and learn the
      hotel business&mdash;thoroughly, and develop this cooked food delivery to
      perfection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Modest young lady,&rdquo; smiled her mother. &ldquo;Where do you mean to stop&mdash;if
      ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mean to stop till I'm dead,&rdquo; Diantha answered; &ldquo;but I don't mean
      to undertake any more trades, if that is what you mean. You know what I'm
      after&mdash;to get 'housework' on a business basis, that's all; and prove,
      prove, PROVE what a good business it is. There's the cleaning branch&mdash;that's
      all started and going well in the day service. There's the washing&mdash;that's
      simple and easy. Laundry work's no mystery. But the food part is a big
      thing. It's an art, a science, a business, and a handicraft. I had the
      handicraft to start with; I'm learning the business; but I've got a lot to
      learn yet in the science and art of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't do too much at once,&rdquo; her mother urged. &ldquo;You've got to cater to
      people as they are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; the girl agreed. &ldquo;They must be led, step by step&mdash;the
      natural method. It's a big job, but not too big. Out of all the women who
      have done housework for so many ages, surely it's not too much to expect
      one to have a special genius for it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her mother gazed at her with loving admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just what you have, Dina&mdash;a special genius for housework. I
      wish there were more of you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are plenty of me, mother dear, only they haven't come out. As soon
      as I show 'em how to make the thing pay, you'll find that we have a big
      percentage of this kind of ability. It's all buried now in the occasional
      'perfect housekeeper.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they won't leave their husbands, Dina.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't need to,&rdquo; the girl answered cheerfully. &ldquo;Some of them aren't
      married yet; some of them have lost their husbands, and <i>some</i> of
      them&rdquo;&mdash;she said this a little bitterly&mdash;&ldquo;have husbands who will
      be willing to let their wives grow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not many, I'm afraid,&rdquo; said Mrs. Bell, also with some gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha lightened up again. &ldquo;Anyhow, here you are, mother dear! And for
      this year I propose that you assume the financial management of the whole
      business at a salary of $1,000 'and found.' How does that suit you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bell looked at her unbelievingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't afford it, Dina!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I can&mdash;you know I can, because you've got the accounts. I'm
      going to make big money this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll need it. This hotel and restaurant business may not do well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, mother, you <i>know</i> we're doing well. Look here!&rdquo; And Diantha
      produced her note-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the little laundry place; its fittings come to so much, wages so
      much, collection and delivery so much, supplies so much&mdash;and already
      enough patronage engaged to cover. It will be bigger in winter, a lot,
      with transients, and this hotel to fall back on; ought to clear at least a
      thousand a year. The service club don't pay me anything, of course; that
      is for the girls' benefit; but the food delivery is doing better than I
      dared hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bell knew the figures better than Diantha, even, and they went over
      them carefully again. If the winter's patronage held on to equal the
      summer's&mdash;and the many transient residents ought to increase it&mdash;they
      would have an average of twenty families a week to provide for&mdash;one
      hundred persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expenses were:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Food for 100 at $250 a week.  Per capita.   $600
             &mdash;-     per year $13,000

     Labor&mdash;delivery man.  $600
     Head cook.  $600
     Two assistant cooks.  $1,040
     Three washers and packers.  $1,560
     Office girl.  $520
          &mdash;-     Per year $4,320

     Rent, kitchen, office, etc.  $500
     Rent of motor.  $300
     Rent of cases.  $250
     Gasolene and repairs.  $630
              &mdash;-     Per year $1,680

     Total.  $19,000
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you make the gasolene and repairs as much as that?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
      Bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's margin, mother&mdash;makes it even money. It won't be so much,
      probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The income was simple and sufficient. They charged $5.00 a week per capita
      for three meals, table d'hote, delivered thrice daily. Frequent orders for
      extra meals really gave them more than they set down, but the
      hundred-person estimate amounted to $26,000 a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, see,&rdquo; said Diantha triumphantly; &ldquo;subtract all that expense list
      (and it is a liberal one), and we have $7,000 left. I can buy the car and
      the cases this year and have $1,600 over! More; because if I do buy them I
      can leave off some of the interest, and the rent of kitchen and office
      comes to Union House! Then there's all of the extra orders. It's going to
      pay splendidly, mother! It clears $70 a year per person. Next year it will
      clear a lot more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It did not take long to make Mrs. Bell admit that if the business went on
      as it had been going Diantha would be able to pay her a salary of a
      thousand dollars, and have five hundred left&mdash;from the food business
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      There remained the hotel, with large possibilities. The present simple
      furnishings were to be moved over to New Union House, and paid for by the
      girls in due time. With new paint, paper, and furniture, the old house
      would make a very comfortable place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it's the restaurant mainly&mdash;these big kitchens and the
      central location are the main thing. The guests will be mostly tourists, I
      suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha dwelt upon the prospect at some length; and even her cautious
      mother had to admit that unless there was some setback the year had a
      prospect of large success.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about all this new furnishing?&rdquo; Mrs. Bell said suddenly. &ldquo;How do you
      cover that? Take what you've got ahead now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; there's plenty,&rdquo; said Diantha. &ldquo;You see, there is all Union House
      has made, and this summer's profit on the cooked food&mdash;it's plenty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can't pay for the motor and cases as you planned,&rdquo; her mother
      insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not unless the hotel and restaurant pays enough to make good. But I
      don't <i>have</i> to buy them the first year. If I don't, there is $5,500
      leeway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are safe enough; there's over $4,000 in the bank now,&rdquo; Mrs. Bell
      admitted. &ldquo;But, child,&rdquo; she said suddenly, &ldquo;your father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've thought of father,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;and I mean to ask him to
      come and live at the hotel. I think he'd like it. He could meet people and
      talk about his ideas, and I'm sure I'd like to have him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They talked much and long about this, till the evening settled about them,
      till they had their quiet supper, and the girls came home to their noisy
      one; and late that evening, when all was still again, Diantha came to the
      dim piazza corner once more and sat there quite alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of hope, full of courage, sure of her progress&mdash;and aching with
      loneliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat with her head in her hands, and to her ears came suddenly the
      sound of a familiar step&mdash;a well-known voice&mdash;the hands and the
      lips of her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Diantha!&rdquo; He held her close.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ross! Ross! Darling! Is it true? When did you come? Oh, I'm so glad!
      So <i>glad</i> to see you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was so glad that she had to cry a little on his shoulder, which he
      seemed to thoroughly enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've good news for you, little girl,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Good news at last!
      Listen, dear; don't cry. There's an end in sight. A man has bought out my
      shop. The incubus is off&mdash;I can <i>live</i> now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held his head up in a fine triumph, and she watched him adoringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you&mdash;was it profitable?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all exchange, and some cash to boot. Just think! You know what I've
      wanted so long&mdash;a ranch. A big one that would keep us all, and let me
      go on with my work. And, dear&mdash;I've got it! It's a big fruit ranch,
      with its own water&mdash;think of that! And a vegetable garden, too, and
      small fruit, and everything. And, what's better, it's all in good running
      order, with a competent ranchman, and two Chinese who rent the vegetable
      part. And there are two houses on it&mdash;<i>two</i>. One for mother and
      the girls, and one for us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha's heart stirred suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it, dear?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed joyfully. &ldquo;It's <i>here!&rdquo;</i> he said. &ldquo;About eight miles or so
      out, up by the mountains; has a little canyon of its own&mdash;its own
      little stream and reservoir. Oh, my darling! My darling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They sat in happy silence in the perfumed night. The strong arms were
      around her, the big shoulder to lean on, the dear voice to call her
      &ldquo;little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The year of separation vanished from their thoughts, and the long years of
      companionship opened bright and glorious before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came this afternoon,&rdquo; he said at length, &ldquo;but I saw another man coming.
      He got here first. I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ross! You didn't! And you've left me to go without you all these hours!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He looked so confident when he went away that I was jealous,&rdquo; Ross
      admitted, &ldquo;furiously jealous. And then your mother was here, and then
      those cackling girls. I wanted you&mdash;alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he had her, alone, for other quiet, happy moments. She was so
      glad of him. Her hold upon his hand, upon his coat, was tight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how I've lived without you,&rdquo; she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I haven't lived. It isn't life&mdash;without you. Well,
      dearest, it needn't be much longer. We closed the deal this afternoon. I
      came down here to see the place, and&mdash;incidentally&mdash;to see you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall turn over the store at once. It won't take long to move and
      settle; there's enough money over to do that. And the ranch pays, Diantha!
      It really <i>pays,</i> and will carry us all. How long will it take you to
      get out of this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of&mdash;what?&rdquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the whole abominable business you're so deep in here. Thank God,
      there's no shadow of need for it any more!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's face went white, but he could not see it. She would not believe
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if your ranch is as near as that it would be
      perfectly easy for me to come in to the business&mdash;with a car. I can
      afford a car soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you there's no need any more,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Don't you understand?
      This is a paying fruit ranch, with land rented to advantage, and a
      competent manager right there running it. It's simply changed owners. I'm
      the owner now! There's two or three thousand a year to be made on it&mdash;has
      been made on it! There is a home for my people&mdash;a home for us! Oh, my
      beloved girl! My darling! My own sweetheart! Surely you won't refuse me
      now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha's head swam dizzily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ross,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;you don't understand! I've built up a good business
      here&mdash;a real successful business. Mother is in it; father's to come
      down; there is a big patronage; it grows. I can't give it up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for me? Not when I can offer you a home at last? Not when I show you
      that there is no longer any need of your earning money?&rdquo; he said hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, dear&mdash;dear!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;It isn't for the money; it is the
      work I want to do&mdash;it is my work! You are so happy now that you can
      do your work&mdash;at last! This is mine!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he spoke again his voice was low and stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that you love&mdash;your work&mdash;better than you love me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! It isn't that! That's not fair!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Do you love your
      work better than you love me? Of course not! You love both. So do I. Can't
      you see? Why should I have to give up anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not have to,&rdquo; he said patiently. &ldquo;I cannot compel you to marry me.
      But now, when at last&mdash;after these awful years&mdash;I can really
      offer you a home&mdash;you refuse!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not refused,&rdquo; she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice lightened again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, dearest! And you will not! You will marry me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will marry you, Ross!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when? When, dearest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as you are ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;can you drop this at once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not drop it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice was low, very low, but clear and steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose to his feet with a muffled exclamation, and walked the length of
      the piazza and back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realize that you are saying no to me, Diantha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken, dear. I have said that I will marry you whenever you
      choose. But it is you who are saying, 'I will not marry a woman with a
      business.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is foolishness!&rdquo; he said sharply. &ldquo;No man&mdash;that is a man&mdash;would
      marry a woman and let her run a business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;One of the finest men I ever knew has
      asked me to marry him&mdash;and keep on with my work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you take him up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I didn't love him.&rdquo; She stopped, a sob in her voice, and he
      caught her in his arms again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late indeed when he went away, walking swiftly, with a black
      rebellion in his heart; and Diantha dragged herself to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was stunned, deadened, exhausted; torn with a desire to run after him
      and give up&mdash;give up anything to hold his love. But something, partly
      reason and partly pride, kept saying within her: &ldquo;I have not refused him;
      he has refused me!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII. ALL THIS.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     They laid before her conquering feet
      The spoils of many lands;
     Their crowns shone red upon her head
      Their scepters in her hands.

     She heard two murmuring at night,
      Where rose-sweet shadows rest;
     And coveted the blossom red
      He laid upon her breast.
</pre>
    <p>
      When Madam Weatherstone shook the plentiful dust of Orchardina from her
      expensive shoes, and returned to adorn the more classic groves of
      Philadelphia, Mrs. Thaddler assumed to hold undisputed sway as a social
      leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Social Leader she meant to be; and marshalled her forces to that end.
      She Patronized here, and Donated there; revised her visiting list with
      rigid exclusiveness; secured an Eminent Professor and a Noted Writer as
      visitors, and gave entertainments of almost Roman magnificence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband grew more and more restive under the rising tide of social
      exactions in dress and deportment; and spent more and more time behind his
      fast horses, or on the stock-ranch where he raised them. As a neighbor and
      fellow ranchman, he scraped acquaintance with Ross Warden, and was able to
      render him many small services in the process of settling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Warden remembered his visit to Jopalez, and it took her some time to
      rearrange him in her mind as a person of wealth and standing. Having so
      rearranged him, on sufficient evidence, she and her daughters became most
      friendly, and had hopes of establishing valuable acquaintance in the town.
      &ldquo;It's not for myself I care,&rdquo; she would explain to Ross, every day in the
      week and more on Sundays, &ldquo;but for the girls. In that dreadful Jopalez
      there was absolutely <i>no</i> opportunity for them; but here, with
      horses, there is no reason we should not have friends. You must consider
      your sisters, Ross! Do be more cordial to Mr. Thaddler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Ross could not at present be cordial to anybody. His unexpected good
      fortune, the freedom from hated cares, and chance to work out his mighty
      theories on the faithful guinea-pig, ought to have filled his soul with
      joy; but Diantha's cruel obstinacy had embittered his cup of joy. He could
      not break with her; she had not refused him, and it was difficult in cold
      blood to refuse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had stayed away for two whole weeks, in which time the guinea-pigs
      nibbled at ease and Diantha's work would have suffered except for her
      mother's extra efforts. Then he went to see her again, miserable but
      stubborn, finding her also miserable and also stubborn. They argued till
      there was grave danger of an absolute break between them; then dropped the
      subject by mutual agreement, and spent evenings of unsatisfying effort to
      talk about other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha and her mother called on Mrs. Warden, of course, admiring the
      glorious view, the sweet high air, and the embowered loveliness of the two
      ranch houses. Ross drew Diantha aside and showed her &ldquo;theirs&rdquo;&mdash;a
      lovely little wide-porched concrete cottage, with a red-tiled roof, and
      heavy masses of Gold of Ophir and Banksia roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her hand and drew her close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her when they were safe inside, and murmured: &ldquo;Come, darling&mdash;won't
      you come and be my wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, Ross&mdash;whenever you say&mdash;but&mdash;!&rdquo; She would not
      agree to give up her work, and he flung away from her in reckless despair.
      Mrs. Warden and the girls returned the call as a matter of duty, but came
      no more; the mother saying that she could not take her daughters to a
      Servant Girls' Club.
    </p>
    <p>
      And though the Servant Girls' Club was soon removed to its new quarters
      and Union House became a quiet, well-conducted hotel, still the two
      families saw but little of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Warden naturally took her son's side, and considered Diantha an
      unnatural monster of hard-heartedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter sifted through to the ears of Mrs. Thaddler, who rejoiced in
      it, and called upon Mrs. Warden in her largest automobile. As a mother
      with four marriageable daughters, Mrs. Warden was delighted to accept and
      improve the acquaintance, but her aristocratic Southern soul was inwardly
      rebellious at the ancestorlessness and uncultured moneyed pride of her new
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only Madam Weatherstone had stayed!&rdquo; she would complain to her
      daughters. &ldquo;She had Family as well as Wealth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's young Mrs. Weatherstone, mother&mdash;&rdquo; suggested Dora.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nobody!&rdquo; her mother replied. &ldquo;She has the Weatherstone money, of
      course, but no Position; and what little she has she is losing by her low
      tastes. She goes about freely with Diantha Bell&mdash;her own
      housekeeper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's not her housekeeper now, mother&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's all the same! She <i>was!</i> And a mere general servant
      before that! And now to think that when Ross is willing to overlook it all
      and marry her, she won't give it up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were all agreed on this point, unless perhaps that the youngest had
      her inward reservations. Dora had always liked Diantha better than had the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mrs. Weatherstone stayed in her big empty house for a while, and as
      Mrs. Warden said, went about frequently with Diantha Bell. She liked Mrs.
      Bell, too&mdash;took her for long stimulating rides in her comfortable
      car, and insisted that first one and then the other of them should have a
      bit of vacation at her seashore home before the winter's work grew too
      heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Mrs. Bell she talked much of how Diantha had helped the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has no idea of the psychic effects, Mrs. Bell,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;She sees
      the business, and she has a great view of all it is going to do for women
      to come; but I don't think she realizes how much she is doing right now
      for women here&mdash;and men, too. There were my friends the Pornes; they
      were 'drifting apart,' as the novels have it&mdash;and no wonder. Isabel
      was absolutely no good as a housekeeper; he naturally didn't like it&mdash;and
      the baby made it all the worse; she pined for her work, you see, and
      couldn't get any time for it. Now they are as happy as can be&mdash;and
      it's just Diantha Bell's doings. The housework is off Isabel's shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there are the Wagrams, and the Sheldons, and the Brinks&mdash;and
      ever so many more&mdash;who have told me themselves that they are far
      happier than they ever were before&mdash;and can live more cheaply. She
      ought to be the happiest girl alive!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bell would agree to this, and quite swelled with happiness and pride;
      but Mrs. Weatherstone, watching narrowly, was not satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had Diantha with her she opened fire direct. &ldquo;You ought to be the
      happiest, proudest, most triumphant woman in the world!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You're
      making oodles of money, your whole thing's going well, and look at your
      mother&mdash;she's made over!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha smiled and said she was happy; but her eyes would stray off to the
      very rim of the ocean; her mouth set in patient lines that were not in the
      least triumphant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about it, my friend,&rdquo; said her hostess. &ldquo;Is it that he won't let
      you keep on with the business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Diantha nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you won't give it up to marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Diantha. &ldquo;No. Why should I? I'd marry him&mdash;to-morrow!&rdquo; She
      held one hand with the other, tight, but they both shook a little. &ldquo;I'd be
      glad to. But I will not give up my work!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look thin,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weatherstone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you sleep well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I can see that you don't eat as you ought to. Hm! Are you going to
      break down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Diantha, &ldquo;I am not going to break down. I am doing what is
      right, and I shall go on. It's a little hard at first&mdash;having him so
      near. But I am young and strong and have a great deal to do&mdash;I shall
      do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then Mrs. Weatherstone would tell her all she knew of the intense
      satisfaction of the people she served, and pleasant stories about the
      girls. She bought her books to read and such gleanings as she found in
      foreign magazines on the subject of organized house-service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only so, but she supplied the Orchardina library with a special
      bibliography on the subject, and induced the new Woman's Club to take up a
      course of reading in it, so that there gradually filtered into the
      Orchardina mind a faint perception that this was not the freak of an
      eccentric individual, but part of an inevitable business development,
      going on in various ways in many nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the winter drew on, Mrs. Weatherstone whisked away again, but kept a
      warm current of interest in Diantha's life by many letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bell came down from Jopalez with outer reluctance but inner
      satisfaction. He had rented his place, and Susie had three babies now.
      Henderson, Jr., had no place for him, and to do housework for himself was
      no part of Mr. Bell's plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Diantha's hotel he had a comfortable room next his wife's, and a
      capacious chair in the firelit hall in wet weather, or on the shaded
      piazza in dry. The excellent library was a resource to him; he found some
      congenial souls to talk with; and under the new stimulus succeeded at last
      in patenting a small device that really worked. With this, and his rent,
      he felt inclined to establish a &ldquo;home of his own,&rdquo; and the soul of Mrs.
      Bell sank within her. Without allowing it to come to an issue between
      them, she kept the question open for endless discussion; and Mr. Bell
      lived on in great contentment under the impression that he was about to
      move at almost any time. To his friends and cronies he dilated with pride
      on his daughter's wonderful achievements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's as good as a boy!&rdquo; he would declare. &ldquo;Women nowadays seem to do
      anything they want to!&rdquo; And he rigidly paid his board bill with a
      flourish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the impressive gatherings at Mrs. Thaddler's, and the humbler
      tea and card parties of Diantha's friends, had a new topic as a
      shuttlecock.
    </p>
    <p>
      A New York company had bought one of the largest and finest blocks in town&mdash;the
      old Para place&mdash;and was developing it in a manner hitherto unseen.
      The big, shabby, neglected estate began to turn into such a fairyland as
      only southern lands can know. The old live-oaks were untouched; the
      towering eucalyptus trees remained in ragged majesty; but an army of
      workmen was busy under guidance of a master of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      One large and lovely building rose, promptly dubbed a hotel by the
      unwilling neighbors; others, smaller, showed here and there among the
      trees; and then a rose-gray wall of concrete ran around the whole, high,
      tantalizing, with green boughs and sweet odors coming over it. Those who
      went in reported many buildings, and much activity. But, when the wall was
      done, and each gate said &ldquo;No admittance except on business,&rdquo; then the work
      of genii was imagined, and there was none to contradict.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a School of Theosophy; it was a Christian Science College; it was a
      Free-Love Colony; it was a Secret Society; it was a thousand wonders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lot of little houses and one big one,&rdquo; the employees said when
      questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hotel and cottages,&rdquo; the employers said when questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made no secret of it, they were too busy; but the town was
      unsatisfied. Why a wall? What did any honest person want of a wall? Yet
      the wall cast a pleasant shadow; there were seats here and there between
      buttresses, and, as the swift California season advanced, roses and
      oleanders nodded over the top, and gave hints of beauty and richness more
      subtly stimulating than all the open glory of the low-hedged gardens near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha's soul was stirred with secret envy. Some big concern was about to
      carry out her dream, or part of it&mdash;perhaps to be a huge and
      overflowing rival. Her own work grew meantime, and flourished as well as
      she could wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The food-delivery service was running to its full capacity; the girls got
      on very well under Mrs. Jessup, and were delighted to have a house of
      their own with the parlors and piazzas all to themselves, and a garden to
      sit in as well. If this depleted their ranks by marriage, it did not
      matter now, for there was a waiting list in training all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Union House kept on evenly and profitably, and Diantha was beginning to
      feel safe and successful; but the years looked long before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was always cheered by Mrs. Weatherstone's letters; and Mrs. Porne came
      to see her, and to compare notes over their friend's success. For Mrs.
      Weatherstone had been presented at Court&mdash;at more than one court, in
      fact; and Mrs. Weatherstone had been proposed to by a Duke&mdash;and had
      refused him! Orchardina well-nigh swooned when this was known.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been studying, investigating, had become known in scientific as
      well as social circles, and on her way back the strenuous upper layer of
      New York Society had also made much of her. Rumors grew of her exquisite
      costumes, of her unusual jewels, of her unique entertainments, of her
      popularity everywhere she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other proposals, of a magnificent nature, were reported, with more
      magnificent refusals; and Orchardina began to be very proud of young Mrs.
      Weatherstone and to wish she would come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did at last, bringing an Italian Prince with her, and a Hoch Geborene
      German Count also, who alleged they were travelling to study the country,
      but who were reputed to have had a duel already on the beautiful widow's
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was long-drawn gossip but bore some faint resemblance to the
      facts. Viva Weatherstone at thirty was a very different woman front the
      pale, sad-eyed girl of four years earlier. And when the great house on the
      avenue was arrayed in new magnificence, and all Orchardina&mdash;that
      dared&mdash;had paid its respects to her, she opened the season, as it
      were, with a brilliant dinner, followed by a reception and ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Orchardina came&mdash;so far as it had been invited. There was the
      Prince, sure enough&mdash;a pleasant, blue-eyed young man. And there was
      the Count, bearing visible evidence of duels a-plenty in earlier days. And
      there was Diantha Bell&mdash;receiving, with Mrs. Porne and Mrs.
      Weatherstone. All Orchardina stared. Diantha had been at the dinner&mdash;that
      was clear. And now she stood there in her soft, dark evening dress, the
      knot of golden acacias nestling against the black lace at her bosom,
      looking as fair and sweet as if she had never had a care in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother thought her the most beautiful thing she had ever seen; and her
      father, though somewhat critical, secretly thought so, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weatherstone cast many a loving look at the tall girl beside her in
      the intervals of &ldquo;Delighted to see you's,&rdquo; and saw that her double burden
      had had no worse effect than to soften the lines of the mouth and give a
      hint of pathos to the clear depths of her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreign visitors were much interested in the young Amazon of Industry,
      as the Prince insisted on calling her; and even the German Count for a
      moment forgot his ancestors in her pleasant practical talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weatherstone had taken pains to call upon the Wardens&mdash;claiming
      a connection, if not a relationship, and to invite them all. And as the
      crowd grew bigger and bigger, Diantha saw Mrs. Warden at last approaching
      with her four daughters&mdash;and no one else. She greeted them politely
      and warmly; but Mrs. Weatherstone did more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holding them all in a little group beside her, she introduced her noble
      visitors to them; imparted the further information that their brother was
      <i>fiance</i> to Miss Bell. &ldquo;I don't see him,&rdquo; she said, looking about.
      &ldquo;He will come later, of course. Ah, Miss Madeline! How proud you all must
      feel of your sister-in-law to be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madeline blushed and tried to say she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a remarkable young lady!&rdquo; said the Count to Adeline. &ldquo;You will
      admire, envy, and imitate! Is it not so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your ladies of America have all things in your hands,&rdquo; said the Prince to
      Miss Cora. &ldquo;To think that she has done so much, and is yet so young&mdash;and
      so beautiful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you're all as proud as you can be,&rdquo; Mrs. Weatherstone continued to
      Dora. &ldquo;You see, Diantha has been heard of abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They all passed on presently, as others came; but Mrs. Warden's head was
      reeling. She wished she could by any means get at Ross, and <i>make</i>
      him come, which he had refused to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't, mother,&rdquo; he had said. &ldquo;You go&mdash;all of you. Take the girls.
      I'll call for you at twelve&mdash;but I won't go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Thaddler were there&mdash;but not happy. She was not, at
      least, and showed it; he was not until an idea struck him. He dodged
      softly out, and was soon flying off, at dangerous speed over the
      moon-white country roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Ross, dressed and ready, sulking blackly on his shadowy porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and take a spin while you wait,&rdquo; said Mr. Thaddler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, I have to go in town later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take you in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, but I have to take the horses in and bring out my mother and
      the girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bring you all out in the car. Come on&mdash;it's a great night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Ross rather reluctantly came.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat back on the luxurious cushions, his arms folded sternly, his brows
      knit, and the stout gentleman at his side watched him shrewdly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does the ranch go?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, thank you, Mr. Thaddler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Them Chinks pay up promptly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As prompt as the month comes round. Their rent is a very valuable part of
      the estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Mr. Thaddler pursued. &ldquo;They have a good steady market for their
      stuff. And the chicken man, too. Do you know who buys 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross did not. Did not greatly care, he intimated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think you'd be interested&mdash;you ought to&mdash;it's Diantha
      Bell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross started, but said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I've taken a great interest in her proposition ever since she
      sprung it on us,&rdquo; Mr. Thaddler confided. &ldquo;She's got the goods all right.
      But there was plenty against her here&mdash;you know what women are! And I
      made up my mind the supplies should be good and steady, anyhow. She had no
      trouble with her grocery orders; that was easy. Meat I couldn't handle&mdash;except
      indirectly&mdash;a little pressure, maybe, here and there.&rdquo; And he
      chuckled softly. &ldquo;But this ranch I bought on purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross turned as if he had been stung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, me. Why not? It's a good property. I got it all fixed right, and
      then I bought your little upstate shop&mdash;lock, stock and barrel&mdash;and
      gave you this for it. A fair exchange is no robbery. Though it would be
      nice to have it all in the family, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross was silent for a few turbulent moments, revolving this far from
      pleasing information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'd I do it for?&rdquo; continued the unasked benefactor. &ldquo;What do you <i>think</i>
      I did it for? So that brave, sweet little girl down here could have her
      heart's desire. She's established her business&mdash;she's proved her
      point&mdash;she's won the town&mdash;most of it; and there's nothing on
      earth to make her unhappy now but your pigheadedness! Young man, I tell
      you you're a plumb fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One cannot throw one's host out of his own swift-flying car; nor is it
      wise to jump out one's self.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing on earth between you but your cussed pride!&rdquo; Mr. Thaddler
      remorselessly went on. &ldquo;This ranch is honestly yours&mdash;by a square
      deal. Your Jopalez business was worth the money&mdash;you ran it honestly
      and extended the trade. You'd have made a heap by it if you could have
      unbent a little. Gosh! I limbered up that store some in twelve months!&rdquo;
       And the stout man smiled reminiscently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross was still silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you've got what you wanted&mdash;thanks to her, mind you, thanks
      to her!&mdash;and you ain't willing to let her have what she wants!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man moistened his lips to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't dependent on her in any sense&mdash;I don't mean that. You
      earned the place all right, and I don't doubt you'll make good, both in a
      business way and a scientific way, young man. But why in Hades you can't
      let her be happy, too, is more'n I can figure! Guess you get your notions
      from two generations back&mdash;and some!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross began, stumblingly. &ldquo;I did not know I was indebted to you, Mr.
      Thaddler.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not, young man, you're not! I ran that shop of yours a year&mdash;built
      up the business and sold it for more than I paid for this. So you've no
      room for heroics&mdash;none at all. What I want you to realize is that
      you're breaking the heart of the finest woman I ever saw. You can't bend
      that girl&mdash;she'll never give up. A woman like that has got more
      things to do than just marry! But she's pining for you all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here she is to-night, receiving with Mrs. Weatherstone&mdash;with those
      Bannerets, Dukes and Earls around her&mdash;standing up there like a
      Princess herself&mdash;and her eyes on the door all the time&mdash;and
      tears in 'em, I could swear&mdash;because you don't come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      They drew up with a fine curve before the carriage gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take 'em all home&mdash;they won't be ready for some time yet,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Thaddler. &ldquo;And if you two would like this car I'll send for the other
      one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ross shook hands with him. &ldquo;You are very kind, Mr. Thaddler,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      am obliged to you. But I think we will walk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tall and impressive, looking more distinguished in a six-year-old evening
      suit than even the Hoch Geborene in his uniform, he came at last, and
      Diantha saw him the moment he entered; saw, too, a new light in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went straight to her. And Mrs. Weatherstone did not lay it up against
      him that he had but the briefest of words for his hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May I take you home&mdash;now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went with him, without a word, and they walked slowly home, by far
      outlying paths, and long waits on rose-bowered seats they knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon filled all the world with tender light and the orange blossoms
      flooded the still air with sweetness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have been a proud fool&mdash;I am yet&mdash;but I have
      come to see a little clearer. I do not approve of your work&mdash;I cannot
      approve of it&mdash;but will you forgive me for that and marry me? I
      cannot live any longer without you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; said Diantha.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV. AND HEAVEN BESIDE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      They were married while the flowers were knee-deep over the sunny slopes
      and mesas, and the canyons gulfs of color and fragrance, and went for
      their first moon together to a far high mountain valley hidden among
      wooded peaks, with a clear lake for its central jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month of heaven; while wave on wave of perfect rest and world-forgetting
      oblivion rolled over both their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      They swam together in the dawn-flushed lake, seeing the morning mists
      float up from the silver surface, breaking the still reflection of thick
      trees and rosy clouds, rejoicing in the level shafts of forest filtered
      sunlight. They played and ran like children, rejoiced over their picnic
      meals; lay flat among the crowding flowers and slept under the tender
      starlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see,&rdquo; said her lover, &ldquo;but that my strenuous Amazon is just as
      much a woman as&mdash;as any woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who ever said I wasn't?&rdquo; quoth Diantha demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      A month of perfect happiness. It was so short it seemed but a moment; so
      long in its rich perfection that they both agreed if life brought no
      further joy this was Enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they came down from the mountains and began living.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Day service is not so easily arranged on a ranch some miles from town.
      They tried it for a while, the new runabout car bringing out a girl in the
      morning early, and taking Diantha in to her office.
    </p>
    <p>
      But motor cars are not infallible; and if it met with any accident there
      was delay at both ends, and more or less friction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Diantha engaged a first-class Oriental gentleman, well recommended by
      the &ldquo;vegetable Chinaman,&rdquo; on their own place. This was extremely
      satisfactory; he did the work well, and was in all ways reliable; but
      there arose in the town a current of malicious criticism and protest&mdash;that
      she &ldquo;did not live up to her principles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this she paid no attention; her work was now too well planted, too
      increasingly prosperous to be weakened by small sneers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother, growing plumper now, thriving continuously in her new lines of
      work, kept the hotel under her immediate management, and did bookkeeping
      for the whole concern. New Union Home ran itself, and articles were
      written about it in magazines; so that here and there in other cities
      similar clubs were started, with varying success. The restaurant was
      increasingly popular; Diantha's cooks were highly skilled and handsomely
      paid, and from the cheap lunch to the expensive banquet they gave
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the &ldquo;c. f. d.&rdquo; was the darling of her heart, and it prospered
      exceedingly. &ldquo;There is no advertisement like a pleased customer,&rdquo; and her
      pleased customers grew in numbers and in enthusiasm. Family after family
      learned to prize the cleanliness and quiet, the odorlessness and
      flylessness of a home without a kitchen, and their questioning guests were
      converted by the excellent of the meals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Critical women learned at last that a competent cook can really produce
      better food than an incompetent one; albeit without the sanctity of the
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sanctity of your bootstraps!&rdquo; protested one irascible gentleman. &ldquo;Such
      talk is all nonsense! I don't want <i>sacred</i> meals&mdash;I want good
      ones&mdash;and I'm getting them, at last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't brag about 'home brewing' any more,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;or 'home
      tailoring,' or 'home shoemaking.' Why all this talk about 'home cooking'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What pleased the men most was not only the good food, but its clock-work
      regularity; and not only the reduced bills but the increased health and
      happiness of their wives. Domestic bliss increased in Orchardina, and the
      doctors were more rigidly confined to the patronage of tourists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross Warden did his best. Under the merciless friendliness of Mr. Thaddler
      he had been brought to see that Diantha had a right to do this if she
      would, and that he had no right to prevent her; but he did not like it any
      the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she rolled away in her little car in the bright, sweet mornings, a
      light went out of the day for him. He wanted her there, in the home&mdash;his
      home&mdash;his wife&mdash;even when he was not in it himself. And in this
      particular case it was harder than for most men, because he was in the
      house a good deal, in his study, with no better company than a polite
      Chinaman some distance off.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by no means easy for Diantha, either. To leave him tugged at her
      heart-strings, as it did at his; and if he had to struggle with inherited
      feelings and acquired traditions, still more was she beset with an
      unexpected uprising of sentiments and desires she had never dreamed of
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      With marriage, love, happiness came an overwhelming instinct of service&mdash;personal
      service. She wanted to wait on him, loved to do it; regarded Wang Fu with
      positive jealousy when he brought in the coffee and Ross praised it. She
      had a sense of treason, of neglected duty, as she left the flower-crowned
      cottage, day by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she left it, she plunged into her work, she schooled herself
      religiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shame on you!&rdquo; she berated herself. &ldquo;Now&mdash;<i>now</i> that you've got
      everything on earth&mdash;to weaken! You could stand unhappiness; can't
      you stand happiness?&rdquo; And she strove with herself; and kept on with her
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, the happiness was presently diluted by the pressure of this
      blank wall between them. She came home, eager, loving, delighted to be
      with him again. He received her with no complaint or criticism, but always
      an unspoken, perhaps imagined, sense of protest. She was full of loving
      enthusiasm about his work, and he would dilate upon his harassed
      guinea-pigs and their development with high satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he never could bring himself to ask about her labors with any genuine
      approval; she was keenly sensitive to his dislike for the subject, and so
      it was ignored between them, or treated by him in a vein of humor with
      which he strove to cover his real feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, before many months were over, the crowning triumph of her effort
      revealed itself, her joy and pride held this bitter drop&mdash;he did not
      sympathize&mdash;did not approve. Still, it was a great glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New York Company announced the completion of their work and the <i>Hotel
      del las Casas</i> was opened to public inspection. &ldquo;House of the Houses!
      That's a fine name!&rdquo; said some disparagingly; but, at any rate, it seemed
      appropriate. The big estate was one rich garden, more picturesque, more
      dreamily beautiful, than the American commercial mind was usually able to
      compass, even when possessed of millions. The hotel of itself was a
      pleasure palace&mdash;wholly unostentatious, full of gaiety and charm,
      offering lovely chambers for guests and residents, and every opportunity
      for healthful amusement. There was the rare luxury of a big swimming-pool;
      there were billiard rooms, card rooms, reading rooms, lounging rooms and
      dancing rooms of satisfying extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside there were tennis-courts, badminton, roque, even croquet; and the
      wide roof was a garden of Babylon, a Court of the Stars, with views of
      purple mountains, fair, wide valley and far-flashing rim of sea. Around
      it, each in its own hedged garden, nestled &ldquo;Las Casas&rdquo;&mdash;the Houses&mdash;twenty
      in number, with winding shaded paths, groups of rare trees, a wilderness
      of flowers, between and about them. In one corner was a playground for
      children&mdash;a wall around this, that they might shout in freedom; and
      the nursery thereby gave every provision for the happiness and safety of
      the little ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people poured along the winding walls, entered the pretty cottages,
      were much impressed by a little flock of well-floored tents in another
      corner, but came back with Ohs! and Ahs! of delight to the large building
      in the Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha went all over the place, inch by inch, her eyes widening with
      admiration; Mr. and Mrs. Porne and Mrs. Weatherstone with her. She enjoyed
      the serene, well-planned beauty of the whole; approved heartily of the
      cottages, each one a little different, each charming in its quiet privacy,
      admired the plentiful arrangements for pleasure and gay association; but
      her professional soul blazed with enthusiasm over the great kitchens,
      clean as a hospital, glittering in glass and copper and cool tiling, with
      the swift, sure electric stove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fuel all went into a small, solidly built power house, and came out in
      light and heat and force for the whole square.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha sighed in absolute appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine, isn't it?&rdquo; said Mr. Porne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like the architecture?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Porne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of my investment?&rdquo; said Mrs. Weatherstone. Diantha
      stopped in her tracks and looked from one to the other of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fact. I control the stock&mdash;I'm president of the Hotel del las Casas
      Company. Our friends here have stock in it, too, and more that you don't
      know. We think it's going to be a paying concern. But if you can make it
      go, my dear, as I think you will, you can buy us all out and own the whole
      outfit!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took some time to explain all this, but the facts were visible enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing remarkable at all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Weatherstone. &ldquo;Here's Astor with
      three big hotels on his hands&mdash;why shouldn't I have one to play with?
      And I've got to employ <i>somebody</i> to manage it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Within a year of her marriage Diantha was at the head of this pleasing
      Centre of Housekeeping. She kept the hotel itself so that it was a joy to
      all its patrons; she kept the little houses homes of pure delight for
      those who were so fortunate as to hold them; and she kept up her &ldquo;c. f.
      d.&rdquo; business till it grew so large she had to have quite a fleet of
      delivery wagons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orchardina basked and prospered; its citizens found their homes happier
      and less expensive than ever before, and its citizenesses began to wake up
      and to do things worth while.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Two years, and there was a small Ross Warden born.
    </p>
    <p>
      She loved it, nursed it, and ran her business at long range for some six
      months. But then she brought nurse and child to the hotel with her, placed
      them in the cool, airy nursery in the garden, and varied her busy day with
      still hours by herself&mdash;the baby in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back they came together before supper, and found unbroken joy and peace in
      the quiet of home; but always in the background was the current of Ross'
      unspoken disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years, four years.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were three babies now; Diantha was a splendid woman of thirty,
      handsome and strong, pre-eminently successful&mdash;and yet, there were
      times when she found it in her heart to envy the most ordinary people who
      loved and quarreled and made up in the little outlying ranch houses along
      the road; they had nothing between them, at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime in the friendly opportunities of Orchardina society, added to by
      the unexampled possibilities of Las Casas (and they did not scorn this
      hotel nor Diantha's position in it), the three older Miss Wardens had
      married. Two of them preferred &ldquo;the good old way,&rdquo; but one tried the &ldquo;d.
      s.&rdquo; and the &ldquo;c. f. d.&rdquo; and liked them well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dora amazed and displeased her family, as soon as she was of age, by
      frankly going over to Diantha's side and learning bookkeeping. She became
      an excellent accountant and bade fair to become an expert manager soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ross had prospered in his work. It may be that the element of
      dissatisfaction in his married life spurred him on, while the unusual
      opportunities of his ranch allowed free effort. He had always held that
      the &ldquo;non-transmissability of acquired traits&rdquo; was not established by any
      number of curtailed mice or crop-eared rats. &ldquo;A mutilation is not an
      acquired trait,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;An acquired trait is one gained by
      exercise; it modifies the whole organism. It must have an effect on the
      race. We expect the sons of a line of soldiers to inherit their fathers'
      courage&mdash;perhaps his habit of obedience&mdash;but not his wooden
      leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To establish his views he selected from a fine family of guinea-pigs two
      pair; set the one, Pair A, in conditions of ordinary guinea-pig bliss, and
      subjected the other, Pair B, to a course of discipline. They were trained
      to run. They, and their descendants after them, pair following on pair;
      first with slow-turning wheels as in squirrel cages, the wheel inexorably
      going, machine-driven, and the luckless little gluttons having to move on,
      for gradually increasing periods of time, at gradually increasing speeds.
      Pair A and their progeny were sheltered and fed, but the rod was spared;
      Pair B were as the guests at &ldquo;Muldoon's&rdquo;&mdash;they had to exercise. With
      scientific patience and ingenuity, he devised mechanical surroundings
      which made them jump increasing spaces, which made them run always a
      little faster and a little farther; and he kept a record as carefully as
      if these little sheds were racing stables for a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several centuries of guinea-pig time went by; generation after generation
      of healthy guinea-pigs passed under his modifying hands; and after some
      five years he had in one small yard a fine group of the descendants of his
      gall-fed pair, and in another the offspring of the trained ones; nimble,
      swift, as different from the first as the razor-backed pig of the forest
      from the fatted porkers in the sty. He set them to race&mdash;the young
      untrained specimens of these distant cousins&mdash;and the hare ran away
      from the tortoise completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great zoologists and biologists came to see him, studied, fingered, poked,
      and examined the records; argued and disbelieved&mdash;and saw them run.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is natural selection,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;It profited them to run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They were fed and cared for alike, with no gain
      from running.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was artificial selection,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;You picked out the speediest
      for your training.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I took always any healthy pair from the trained
      parents and from the untrained ones&mdash;quite late in life, you
      understand, as guinea-pigs go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow, there were the pigs; and he took little specialized piglets scarce
      weaned, and pitted them against piglets of the untrained lot&mdash;and
      they outran them in a race for &ldquo;Mama.&rdquo; Wherefore Mr. Ross Warden found
      himself famous of a sudden; and all over the scientific world the
      Wiesmanian controversy raged anew. He was invited to deliver a lecture
      before some most learned societies abroad, and in several important
      centers at home, and went, rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha was glad for him from the bottom of her heart, and proud of him
      through and through. She thoroughly appreciated his sturdy opposition to
      such a weight of authority; his long patience, his careful, steady work.
      She was left in full swing with her big business, busy and successful,
      honored and liked by all the town&mdash;practically&mdash;and quite
      independent of the small fraction which still disapproved. Some people
      always will. She was happy, too, in her babies&mdash;very happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hotel del las Casas was a triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha owned it now, and Mrs. Weatherstone built others, in other places,
      at a large profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Warden went to live with Cora in the town. Cora had more time to
      entertain her&mdash;as she was the one who profited by her sister-in-law's
      general services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha sat in friendly talk with Mrs. Weatherstone one quiet day, and
      admitted that she had no cause for complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet&mdash;?&rdquo; said her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Mrs. Warden smiled. &ldquo;There's no keeping anything from you, is there?
      Yes&mdash;you're right. I'm not quite satisfied. I suppose I ought not to
      care&mdash;but you see, I love him so! I want him to <i>approve</i> of me!&mdash;not
      just put up with it, and bear it! I want him to <i>feel</i> with me&mdash;to
      care. It is awful to know that all this big life of mine is just a mistake
      to him&mdash;that he condemns it in his heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you knew this from the beginning, my dear, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I knew it&mdash;but it is different now. You know when you are
      <i>married</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Weatherstone looked far away through the wide window. &ldquo;I do know,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diantha reached a strong hand to clasp her friend's. &ldquo;I wish I could give
      it to you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You have done so much for me! So much! You have
      poured out your money like water!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My money! Well I like that!&rdquo; said Mrs. Weatherstone. &ldquo;I have taken my
      money out of five and seven per cent investments, and put it into ten per
      cent ones, that's all. Shall I never make you realize that I am a richer
      woman because of you, Diantha Bell Warden! So don't try to be grateful&mdash;I
      won't have it! Your work has <i>paid</i> remember&mdash;paid me as well as
      you; and lots of other folks beside. You know there are eighteen good
      imitations of Union House running now, in different cities, and three 'Las
      Casas!' all succeeding&mdash;and the papers are talking about the dangers
      of a Cooked Food Trust!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were friends old and tried, and happy in mutual affection. Diantha
      had many now, though none quite so dear. Her parents were contented&mdash;her
      brother and sister doing well&mdash;her children throve and grew and found
      Mama a joy they never had enough of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet still in her heart of hearts she was not wholly happy.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Then one night came by the last mail, a thick letter from Ross&mdash;thicker
      than usual. She opened it in her room alone, their room&mdash;to which
      they had come so joyously five years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her of his journeying, his lectures, his controversies and
      triumphs; rather briefly&mdash;and then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, I have learned something at last, on my travels, which will
      interest you, I fancy, more than the potential speed of all the
      guinea-pigs in the world, and its transmissability.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what I hear about you in foreign lands; from what I read about you
      wherever I go; and, even more, from what I see, as a visitor, in many
      families; I have at last begun to grasp the nature and importance of your
      work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As a man of science I must accept any truth when it is once clearly seen;
      and, though I've been a long time about it, I do see at last what brave,
      strong, valuable work you have been doing for the world. Doing it
      scientifically, too. Your figures are quoted, your records studied, your
      example followed. You have established certain truths in the business of

      appreciate your work. As man to man I'm proud of you&mdash;tremendously
      proud of you. As your husband! Ah! my love! I am coming back to you&mdash;coming

      Diantha held the letter close, with hands that shook a little. She kissed
      it&mdash;kissed it hard, over and over&mdash;not improving its appearance
      as a piece of polite correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she gave way to an overmastering burst of feeling, and knelt down by
      the wide bed, burying her face there, the letter still held fast. It was a
      funny prayer, if any human ear had heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; was all she said, with long, deep sobbing sighs between.
      &ldquo;Thank you!&mdash;O&mdash;thank you!&rdquo;

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
